# Leveraging-LLMs-on-Root-Level-Education-System
## About

The **PDF-based QA Assistant** project is designed to transform the educational landscape in Bangladesh by integrating advanced **Large Language Models (LLMs)** into the foundational education system. Using **Llama2** and **LlamaIndex**, this assistant allows students and teachers to interact directly with course materials in PDF form, asking questions and receiving comprehensive, contextual answers. This tool serves as a bridge to deeper understanding, offering students a chance to explore vast amounts of information at their own pace and based on their individual learning needs.

### Primary Goals

- **Enhancing Student Learning**: The assistant empowers students to gain a richer, more nuanced understanding of subjects. By answering questions directly from their study materials, students can engage more deeply with the content and explore complex ideas independently.

- **Supporting Teachers**: This project also provides teachers with a powerful resource for creating high-quality content. By generating context-based answers and explanations, teachers can easily prepare and present complex topics in a student-friendly manner, enhancing the quality of instruction and fostering an engaging learning environment.

### Vision

By integrating LLMs into the educational ecosystem, we aim to create a knowledge-based culture that empowers students to think critically, solve complex problems, and develop essential 21st-century skills. This project envisions an accessible, inclusive, and intelligent educational future for Bangladesh, where students and teachers alike have the resources needed to excel.
