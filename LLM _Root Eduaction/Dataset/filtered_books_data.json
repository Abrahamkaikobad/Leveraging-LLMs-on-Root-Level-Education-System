            "Page1": "Kari, a five-month-old baby elephant, lives and grows up with his nine-year-old friend and keeper. Kari doesn\u2019t eat much\u2014just about sixteen kilograms of delicious twigs a day. Playful and sensitive, Kari saves a boy from drowning. KARI, the elephant, was five months old when he was given to me to take care of. I was nine years old and I could reach his back if I stood on tiptoe. He seemed to remain that high for nearly two years. We grew together; that is probably why I never found out just how tall he was. He lived in a pavilion, under a thatched roof which rested on thick tree stumps so that it could not fall in when Kari bumped against the poles as he moved about. One of the first things Kari did was to save the life of a boy. Kari did not eat much but he nevertheless needed forty pounds of twigs a day to chew and play with. Every day I used to take him to the river in the morning for his bath. He would lie down on the sand bank while I rubbed him with the clean sand of the river for an hour. After that he would lie in the water for a long time. On coming out his skin would be shining like ebony, and he would squeal squeal: cry/trumpet",

Then I would take him by the ear, because that is the easiest way to lead an elephant, and leave him on the edge of the jungle while I went into the forest to get some luscious twigs for his dinner. One has to have a very sharp hatchet to cut down these twigs; it takes half an hour to sharpen the hatchet because if a twig is mutilated an elephant will not touch it. It was not an easy job to get twigs and saplings for Kari. I had to climb all kinds of trees to get the most delicate and tender twigs. As he was very fond of the young branches of the banyan tree which grows like a cathedral of leaves and branches, I was gathering some, one spring day in March, when I suddenly heard Kari calling to me in the distance. As he was still very young, the call was more like that of a baby than an elephant. I thought somebody was hurting luscious: tasty and sweet smelling hatchet: small axe mutilated: torn awkwardly/disfigured",
            "Page3": "9 Bringing up Kari him, so I came down from my tree and ran very fast to the edge of the forest where I had left him, but he was not there. I looked all over, but I could not find him. I went near the edge of the water, and I saw a black something struggling above its surface. Then it rose higher and it was the trunk of my elephant. I thought he was drowning. I was helpless because I could not jump into the water and save the four hundred pounds of him since he was much higher than I. But I saw his back rise above the water and the moment he caught my eye, he began to trumpet and struggle up to the shore. Then, still trumpeting, he pushed me into the water and, as I fell into the stream, I saw a boy lying flat on the bottom of the river. He had not altogether touched bottom but was somewhat afloat. I came to the surface of the water to take my breath and there Kari was standing, his feet planted in the sand bank and his trunk stretched out like a hand waiting for mine. I dived down again and pulled the body of the drowning boy to the surface but, not being a good swimmer, I could not swim ashore and the slow current was already dragging me down. Seeing us drift by in the current, Kari, who was usually slow and ponderous, suddenly darted down like a hawk and came halfway into the water where I saw him stretch out his trunk again. I raised up my hand to catch it and it slipped. I found myself going under the water again, but",
            "Page4": "10 An Alien Hand this time I found that the water was not very deep so I sank to the bottom of the river and doubled my feet under me and then suddenly kicked the river bed and so shot upwards like an arrow, in spite of the fact that I was holding the drowning boy with my hand. As my body rose above the water, I felt a lasso around my neck. This frightened me; I thought some water animal was going to swallow me. I heard Kari squealing, and I knew it was his trunk about my neck. He pulled us both ashore. Kari becomes fond of ripe bananas. He believes in self-help, much to the discomfort of his friend. With quiet dignity, Kari accepts the chiding he knows he deserves. Kari was like a baby. He had to be trained to be good and if you did not tell him when he was naughty, he was up to more mischief than ever. For instance, one day, somebody gave him some bananas to eat. Very soon he developed a great love for ripe bananas. We used to keep large plates of fruit on a table near a window in the dining-room. One day all the bananas on that table disappeared and my family blamed the servants for eating all the fruit in the house. A few days later the fruit disappeared again; this time the blame was put on me, and I knew I had not done it. It made me very angry with my parents and the servants, for I was sure they had taken all the fruit. The next time the fruit disappeared, I found a banana all smashed up in Kari\u2019s pavilion. This surprised me very much, for I had never seen fruit there and, as you know, he had always lived on twigs. Next day, while I was sitting in the dining-room wondering whether I should take some fruit from the table lasso: rope with a noose at the end",
            "Page5": "11 Bringing up Kari without my parents\u2019 permission, a long, black thing, very much like a snake, suddenly came through the window and disappeared with all the bananas. I was very much frightened because I had never seen snakes eat bananas and I thought it must be a terrible snake that would sneak in and take fruit. I crept out of the room and with great fear in my heart ran out of the house, feeling sure that the snake would come back into the house, eat all the fruit and kill all of us. As I went out, I saw Kari\u2019s back disappearing in the direction of the pavilion and I was so frightened that I wanted his company to cheer me up. I ran after him into the pavilion and I found him there eating bananas. I stood still in astonishment; the bananas were lying strewn all around him. He stretched out his trunk and reached for one far away from where he was standing. That instant the",
            "Page6": "12 An Alien Hand trunk looked like a black snake, and I realised that Kari was the thief. I went to him, pulled him out by the ear and joyously showed my parents that it was Kari and not I that had eaten all the fruit these many weeks. Then I scolded him, for elephants understand words as well as children, and I said to him, \u201cNext time I see you stealing fruit, you will be whipped.\u201d He knew that we were all angry with him, even the servants. His pride was so injured that he never stole another thing from the dining-room. And from then on, if anybody gave him any fruit, he always squealed as if to thank them. An elephant is willing to be punished for having done wrong, but if you punish him without any reason, he will remember it and pay you back in your own coin. Kari is a fast learner. He masters all signals and sounds he is taught. There is one lesson, though, that an elephant takes five years to learn. Kari is no exception. An elephant must be taught when to sit down, when to walk, when to go fast, and when to go slow. You teach him these things as you teach a child. If you say \u2018Dhat\u2019 and pull him by the ear, he will gradually learn to sit down. Similarly, if you say \u2018Mali\u2019 and pull his trunk forward, he will gradually learn that it is the signal to walk. Kari learned \u2018Mali\u2019 after three lessons, but it took him three weeks to learn \u2018Dhat\u2019. He was no good at sitting down. And do you know why an elephant should be taught to sit down? Because he grows taller and taller than you who take care of him, so that when he is two or three years old,",
            "Page7": "13 Bringing up Kari you can only reach his back with a ladder. It is, therefore, better to teach him to sit down by saying \u2018Dhat\u2019 so that you can climb upon his back, for who would want to carry a ladder around all the time? The most difficult thing to teach an elephant is the master call. He generally takes five years to learn it properly. The master call is a strange hissing, howling sound, as if a snake and a tiger were fighting each other, and you have to make that kind of noise in his ear. And do you know what you expect an elephant to do when you give him the master call? If you are lost in the jungle and there is no way out, and everything is black except the stars above, you dare not stay very long anywhere. The only thing to do then is to give the master call and at once the elephant pulls down the tree in front of him with his trunk. This frightens all the animals away. As the tree comes crashing down, monkeys wake from their sleep and run from branch to branch\u2014",
            "Page8": "14 An Alien Hand you can see them in the moonlight\u2014and you can almost see the stags running in all directions below. You can hear the growl of the tiger in the distance. Even he is frightened. Then the elephant pulls down the next tree and the next, and the next. Soon you will find that he has made a road right through the jungle straight to your house. DHAN GOPAL MUKERJI (from Kari, the Elephant) Answer the following questions. 1. The enclosure in which Kari lived had a thatched roof that lay on thick tree stumps. Examine the illustration of Kari\u2019s pavilion on page 8 and say why it was built that way. 2. Did Kari enjoy his morning bath in the river? Give a reason for your answer. 3. Finding good twigs for Kari took a long time. Why? 4. Why did Kari push his friend into the stream? 5. Kari was like a baby. What are the main points of comparison? 6. Kari helped himself to all the bananas in the house without anyone noticing it. How did he do it? 7. Kari learnt the commands to sit and to walk. What were the instructions for each command? 8. What is \u201cthe master call\u201d? Why is it the most important signal for an elephant to learn?"

In what ways is an ant\u2019s life peaceful? The queen ant has a pair of wings, which she casts off before she begins to lay eggs. Eggs hatch and become grubs, grubs change into cocoons, and cocoons break to bring forth complete ants. The life of an ordinary ant in the anthill is a book which many of us seldom open. The queen is the mother of the entire population of the colony. It lives for about fifteen years. It has a pair of wings,",

The queen leaves the nest and goes out to meet a male ant, or drone, high up in the air. On its return to earth, it gets rid of its wings and then does nothing but lay eggs. Eggs hatch and grubs come out. Soldiers guard them. Workers feed and clean them, and also carry them about daily for airing, exercise and sunshine. Two or three weeks later, grubs become cocoons and lie without food or activity for three weeks more. Then the cocoons break and perfect ants appear. Now it\u2019s time for teaching and training. New ants learn their duties from old ants as workers, soldiers, builders, cleaners, etc. After a few weeks\u2019 training, the small ants are ready to go out into the big world of work. An anthill is a home not only for ants but also for some other creatures\u2014beetles, lesser breeds of ants and the greenfly. Why do ants want these alien creatures to live in their nests?

            "Page3": "THE National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children\u2019s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy of Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this supplementary reader proves for making children\u2019s life at school a happy experience rather than a source of stress or boredom.

It seeks to enable them to read independently in the sense that they would not expect the book to be taken up page by page in the classroom. They would rather read it on their own and later share and confirm their responses and appreciation with the teacher and the peer group through discussions, questions and, wherever possible, even role-play. The book contains ten pieces. Each piece has been divided into two or three manageable sections, each section briefly summarised in point form without revealing crucial turns and twists of the storyline, thus sustaining readers\u2019 curiosity and interest. While-reading \u2018Comprehension Check,\u2019 given at the end of sections, is a recall of what has been read and understood so far. This format is being tried to make comprehension easier and concentration keener. Each piece is also followed by a set of questions as aids to understanding and, at many places, topics for discussion in groups. All questions should be attempted orally before well-formulated answers are put down on paper. Discussion on related topics should be encouraged so that learners get an opportunity to go beyond the book and feel inspired to reach hitherto undiscovered vistas of knowledge and pleasure. The stories, amply illustrated, deal with themes of cooperation, compassion, respect and love for flora and fauna, sound decision-making, science fiction, peace and harmony. It is hoped that young readers will find the book enjoyable and rewarding, and will feel motivated to read extensively on their own to become proficient readers in the years to come.",

He roamed freely during the day, but was put on the chain at night. THERE was once a lady who lived in an old manor-house on the border of a big forest. This lady had a pet bear she was very fond of. It had been found in the forest, half dead of hunger, so small and helpless that it had to be brought up on the bottle by the lady and the old cook. This was several years ago and now it had grown up to a big bear, so big and strong that he could have slain a cow and carried it away between his two paws if he had wanted to. But he did not want to; he was a most amiable bear who did not dream of harming anybody, man or beast. He used to sit outside his kennel and look with his small intelligent eyes most amicably at the cattle grazing in the field near by. The three shaggy mountain ponies in the stable knew him well and did not mind in the least when he shuffled into the stable with his mistress. The children used to ride on his back and had more than once been found asleep in his kennel between his two paws. The three dogs loved to play all sorts of games with him, pull his ears and his stump of a tail",

He had never tasted meat; he ate the same food as the dogs and often out of the same plate\u2014bread, porridge, potato, cabbage, turnip. He had a fine appetite, and his friend, the cook, saw to it that he got his fill. Bears are vegetarians if they have a chance, and fruit is what they like best. In the autumn he used to sit and look with wistful eyes at the ripening apples in the orchard, and in his young days he had been sometimes unable to resist the temptation to climb the tree and help himself to a handful of them. Bears look clumsy and slow in their movements, but try a bear with an apple tree and you will soon find out that he can easily beat any school boy at that game. Now he had learnt that it was against the law, but he kept his small eyes wide open for any apples that fell to the ground. There had also been some difficulties about the beehives; he had been punished for this by being put on the chain for two days with a bleeding nose and he had never done it again. Otherwise he was never put on the chain except for the",

The lady visited her sister every Sunday, leaving the bear on the chain the whole afternoon. One Sunday, while walking through the dense forest, she found him following her. She was so angry with the disobedient bear that she hit him on the nose with her umbrella. But the bear was really friendly... He was also put on the chain on Sundays when his mistress went to spend the afternoon with her married sister who lived in a solitary house on the other side of the mountain-lake, a good hour\u2019s walk through the dense forest. It was not supposed to be good for him to wander about in the forest with all its temptations; it was better to be on the safe side. He was also a bad sailor and had once taken such a fright at a sudden gust of wind that he had upset the boat and he and his mistress had to swim to the shore. Now he knew quite well what it meant when his mistress put him on the chain on Sundays, with a friendly tap on his head and the promise of an apple on her return if he had been good during her absence. He was sorry but resigned, like a good dog, when his mistress tells him he cannot come with her for a walk. One Sunday when the lady had chained him up as usual and was about half-way through the forest, she suddenly thought she heard the cracking of a tree-branch on the winding footpath behind her. She looked back and was horrified to see the bear coming along full speed. Bears look as if they move along quite slowly but they shuffle along much faster than a trotting horse.

She told him in her severest voice to go back at once, menacing him with her parasol. He stopped a moment and looked at her with his cunning eyes, but did not want to go back and kept on sniffing at her. When the lady saw that he had even lost his new collar, she got still more angry and hit him on the nose with her parasol so hard that it broke in two.

She went up to him and began to scold him most severely and said he would have to be chained for two more days. The old cook who loved the bear as if he had been her son rushed out from the kitchen very angry. \u201cWhat are you scolding him for, missus,\u201d said the cook; \u201che has been as good as gold the whole day, bless him!

ONCE upon a time there lived an old man in Almora. He was popularly known as Abbu Khan. He lived all alone except for a few goats which he always kept as pets. He gave his goats funny names such as Kalua, Moongia or Gujri. He would take them out for grazing during the day and talk to them as one talks to one\u2019s own children; at night he would bring them back to his little hut and put a string round the neck of each goat. Poor Abbu Khan was a little unlucky in the matter of his goats. Very often at night one of the goats would pull and pull at the string till it broke loose, and then would disappear in the hills beyond. Goats in hilly regions hate being tied to trees or poles. They love their freedom. Abbu Khan\u2019s goats were of the best hill breed. They too loved their freedom. So whenever they got the chance, they would run away only to get killed by an old wolf who lived in the hills. Whenever one of his goats disappeared, Abbu Khan was very sad.

One day, when all his goats had left him, Abbu Khan said to himself, \u201cNo more goats in my house ever again. I may yet live for a few more years but I\u2019ll live without goats.\u201d However, the poor old man was terribly lonely. He simply couldn\u2019t do without his pets.

Abbu Khan called her Chandni, which means \u2018moonlight\u2019. He loved Chandni and would narrate to her stories of all his friends who were dead and gone. Several years passed; Chandni was still there. Abbu Khan believed that Chandni would never leave his compound for the free and fresh air of the hills beyond. Alas! he was mistaken again. 1. Why did Abbu Khan\u2019s goats want to run away? What happened to them in the hills? 2. Abbu Khan said, \u201cNo more goats in my house ever again.\u201d Then he changed his mind. Why? 3. Why did he buy a young goat?",

The story of the dangerous wolf in the forest did not discourage Chandni. Every morning Chandni watched the hilltops bathed in the sunlight. \u201cHow beautiful those hills are!\u201d she thought. \u201cHow refreshing the breeze that blows through them! And how lovely to run across those green fields!\u201d She ran towards the hills but had to stop with a jerk\u2014the rope round her neck wouldn\u2019t let her go any further. How she hated that rope! She stopped eating the green grass Abbu Khan brought for her; nor did she listen to his stories with interest and affection. She lost her appetite, grew very thin and stared moodily at the hilltops bathed in sunlight. Abbu Khan did not understand Chandni\u2019s anguish. At last, she decided to speak to him frankly. \u201cDear Abbu Khan,\u201d she said, \u201clet me go to the hills, please. If I stay on in your compound, I\u2019ll die.\u201d Now Abbu Khan understood Chandni\u2019s problem, but it made him very unhappy. The earthen pot which contained Chandni\u2019s breakfast fell from his hands and broke into a thousand pieces. \u201cWhy do you want to leave me, Chandni?\u201d Abbu Khan asked. \u201cI want to go to the hills,\u201d Chandni answered. \u201cDon\u2019t you like the food here? I\u2019ll give you tastier food and a much longer rope.\u201d \u201cNo, thank you. Let me go to the hills.\u201d \u201cDo you realise the risk you are running, you obstinate creature? There is a dangerous wolf in the hills. He\u2019ll eat you up.\u201d Abbu Khan did his best to warn her. Chandni answered, \u201cGod has given me a pair of horns. I\u2019ll fight the wolf.\u201d",

Ungrateful as you are, you must still be saved from the wolf.\u201d He pushed her into a small hut and shut the door. But he forgot to close the small window at the back. The same night Chandni made that window her passage to freedom.",

Abbu Khan pushed Chandni into a small hut. This shows that he (i) was cruel. (ii) loved her and wanted to save her life. (iii) was selfish. Chandni went back to the hills. She knew the wolf was somewhere there. She was ready to put up a good fight. Chandni reached the hills. It seemed to her that the old hills were standing in a row to welcome her. She felt like a child meeting her parents after years of separation. Wherever she went, the tall grass rose to embrace her, the flowers bloomed to amuse her and the wind sang an endless song of welcome. How different all this was from her past in the prison-house of Abbu Khan\u2019s compound! It was the happiest day in Chandni\u2019s life. That day she played for hours on the grassy slopes of the hills. She met a herd of wild goats who asked her to join their group. But Chandni politely refused. She wanted to enjoy her new freedom all by herself. The sun disappeared behind the hills, and soon darkness enveloped the grass, the flowers and the trees. The wind stopped blowing, and there was stillness all around except for a strange sound which was coming from the bushes. The sound was like a grunt. What was it? It wasn\u2019t Abbu Khan\u2019s voice calling her back to the compound; nor was it the voice of another goat. Then Chandni thought of the dangerous wolf who lived in the hills. She felt scared.",

The wolf had come out of the bushes, and was staring greedily at Chandni. His eyes were shining like burning coals in the darkness. He seemed in no hurry. He knew the new goat was his. The wolf and the goat sized up each other. The wolf was big and ferocious whereas the goat, though healthy, was small. But small is not weak. Chandni stood firm on her legs, head slightly bent and horns jutting out. She was a picture of courage. She looked like a brave soldier ready to fight a treacherous enemy. \u201cI must put up a good fight,\u201d Chandni thought; \u201csuccess or failure is a matter of luck or chance.\u201d The fight began. It went on through the night. The moon, which had been watching the fight, began to grow pale and",

A faint light appeared in the east and the morning call for prayer came from a distant mosque. The first rays of the sun saw Chandni lying on the ground. She was completely soaked in blood. The wolf, tired and sleepy, was getting ready to devour her. An assembly of birds perched on top of a tree nearby was debating the result of the fight. \u201cWho is the winner?\u201d one of them asked. \u201cThe wolf, of course,\u201d most of them said. A wise old bird declaimed with confidence, \u201cChandni is the winner.\u201d ZAKIR HUSAIN (an adaptation) 1. Why did Chandni refuse to join the group of wild goats? 2.

Why did the wise old bird say, \u201cChandni is the winner\u201d? 2. \u201cDeath in an open field is better than life in a small hut,\u201d Chandni said to herself. Was it the right decision?

The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA) Viking Mission to Mars was composed of two spacecraft, Viking 1 and Viking 2, each consisting of an orbiter and a lander. The primary objectives were to obtain images and samples of the Martian surface and soil and search for any possible signs of life. Viking 1 was launched on 20 August 1975 and arrived at Mars on 19 June 1976. Viking 2 was launched on 9 September 1975 and entered Mars\u2019 orbit on 7 August 1976. Besides taking photographs and collecting other science data on the Martian surface, the two landers conducted three biology experiments to look for possible signs of life. As of now, there is no clear evidence of the presence of living microorganisms in the soil near the landing sites. Now read the story. Tilloo and his parents live beneath the surface of a planet under artificial conditions. Tilloo has heard and read about the sun and the stars. He has never seen them.

Tilloo\u2019s father went every day for work along that passage. And every day he came back from that direction. What lay at the end of that forbidden route? Not only Tilloo, but a great majority of the community would have liked to know. Tilloo\u2019s father was one of the select few permitted to go that way. The above conversation invariably took place between Tilloo and his mother whenever he insisted on following his father. Today, however, was different. Tilloo\u2019s father was enjoying a siesta at home and Tilloo managed to get hold of his security card. Then, evading his watchful mother\u2019s eye, Tilloo made his way to the forbidden passage. A metal door barred his entry. But Tilloo had watched his father slip the magic card into a slot. He did the same... and the door opened noiselessly . A well-lit passage seemed to beckon him. Snatching the card which had come out of another slot in the wall, Tilloo started his march along a gentle upward slope\u2014for the passage led from the underground habitat to the surface of the planet. Tilloo looked forward to seeing the sun (if it was daytime) or the stars (if it was night) about which he had heard and read so much. But alas, that wasn\u2019t to be! Tilloo had underestimated the security arrangements. Invisible mechanical devices had already detected and photographed the small intruder, sent his picture to the Central Bureau where it was thoroughly checked... And before he had advanced ten paces a strong hand fell heavily on his shoulder.

Now, in the days of energy shortage and underground life, they had no space programme. They could only watch impotently from their vantage point. Who were these strangers?

All eyes were now glued to the screen. A mechanical hand was emerging from the spacecraft. It was approaching the surface of the planet. It bent and touched the soil. What was it up to? People crowded towards the screen for a closer look. The telescopic lens of the TV camera zoomed in to the tip of the mechanical hand. Tilloo was staring at the control panel and its attractive buttons. An irresistible desire got hold of him to press the most prominent of all buttons, the red one. He moved... There was a shrill whistle and Tilloo found himself the centre of attention. His father pulled him away roughly and restored the red button to neutral position. But the damage was done. The mechanical hand from the spacecraft ceased to work. At a press conference held by NASA, a scientist was briefing the world press: ... Everything has been going on smoothly with the Viking Mission. There is a small hitch. The mechanical hand which was to dig out the Martian soil for examination has developed a malfunction... We don\u2019t know the cause but our technicians are confident they\u2019ll sort it out...",

If you had to live in a home like Tilloo\u2019s, what parts of life would you find most difficult? What compensations might there be? 2. What, if anything, might drive mankind to make their homes underground? 3. Do you think there is life on other planets? Can you guess what kind of people there may be on them? In what ways are they likely to be different from us? And shortly afterwards there was another press release from NASA: ... The mechanical hand is working again, thanks to the efforts of our technicians. Soil samples are being collected and examined\u2026 Soon we will know the answer to the question whether there is life on Mars. Life on Mars? Of all the planets in our solar system, Mars is nearest in location and physical conditions to our Earth. So the scientists behind the Viking Mission were hopeful of finding life on Mars. But they were in for a disappointment. The Viking Mission found no signs of life on Mars. JAYANT NARLIKAR",

This news report, based on a more expansive view of where life can take root, may have NASA looking for a different type of Martian life form when its next Mars spacecraft is launched later this year, one of the space agency\u2019s top scientists told reporters.

One day, when Grandfather was strolling down the forest path at some distance from the rest of the party, he discovered a little tiger about eighteen inches long, hiding among the intricate roots of a banyan tree. Grandfather picked him up, and brought him home. He had the distinction of being the only member of the party to have bagged any game, dead or alive. At first the tiger-cub, who was named Timothy by Grandmother, was brought up entirely on milk given to him in a feeding-bottle by our cook, Mahmoud. But the milk proved too rich for him, and he was put on a diet of raw mutton and cod-liver oil, to be followed later by a more tempting diet of pigeons and rabbits.

About six months later, when my grandparents were visiting relatives in Lucknow, Grandfather took the opportunity of calling at the zoo to see how Timothy was getting on. I was not there to accompany him but I heard all about it when I returned to Dehra. Arriving at the zoo, Grandfather made straight for the particular cage in which Timothy had been interned. The tiger was there, crouched in a corner, full-grown and with a magnificent striped coat. \u201cHello Timothy!\u201d said Grandfather and put his arm through the bars of the cage.

Mass of Uranus is 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. Which has greater mass, Earth or Uranus? Distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m and distance between Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m. Can you read these numbers? Which distance is less? These very large numbers are difficult to read, understand and compare. To make these numbers easy to read, understand and compare, we use exponents. In this Chapter, we shall learn about exponents and also learn how to use them. 11.2 EXPONENTS We can write large numbers in a shorter form using exponents. Observe 10, 000 = 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 104 The short notation 104 stands for the product 10\u00d710\u00d710\u00d710. Here \u201810\u2019 is called the base and \u20184\u2019 the exponent. The number 104 is read as 10 raised to the power of 4 or simply as fourth power of 10. 104 is called the exponential form of 10,000. We can similarly express 1,000 as a power of 10. Note that 1000 = 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 103 Here again, 103 is the exponential form of 1,000. Similarly, 1,00,000 = 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 105 105 is the exponential form of 1,00,000 In both these examples, the base is 10; in case of 103, the exponent is 3 and in case of 105 the exponent is 5. Exponents and Powers Chapter 11 2024-25",
            "Page2": "EXPONENTS AND POWERS 171 We have used numbers like 10, 100, 1000 etc., while writing numbers in an expanded form. For example, 47561 = 4 \u00d7 10000 + 7 \u00d7 1000 + 5 \u00d7 100 + 6 \u00d7 10 + 1 This can be written as 4 \u00d7 104 + 7 \u00d7103 + 5 \u00d7 102 + 6 \u00d7 10 + 1. Try writing these numbers in the same way 172, 5642, 6374. In all the above given examples, we have seen numbers whose base is 10. However the base can be any other number also. For example: 81 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 can be written as 81 = 34, here 3 is the base and 4 is the exponent. Some powers have special names. For example, 102, which is 10 raised to the power 2, also read as \u201810 squared\u2019 and 103, which is 10 raised to the power 3, also read as \u201810 cubed\u2019. Can you tell what 53 (5 cubed) means? 53 = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 125 So, we can say 125 is the third power of 5. What is the exponent and the base in 53? Similarly, 25 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 32, which is the fifth power of 2. In 25, 2 is the base and 5 is the exponent. In the same way, 243 = 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 = 35 64 = 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 = 26 625 = 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 5 = 54 Find five more such examples, where a number is expressed in exponential form.

We said that large numbers can be conveniently expressed using exponents. We have not as yet shown this. We shall do so now. 1. Sun is located 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m from the centre of our Milky Way Galaxy. 2. Number of stars in our Galaxy is 100,000,000,000. 3. Mass of the Earth is 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg. These numbers are not convenient to write and read. To make it convenient we use powers. Observe the following: 59 = 5.9 \u00d7 10 = 5.9 \u00d7 101 590 = 5.9 \u00d7 100 = 5.9 \u00d7 102 5900 = 5.9 \u00d7 1000 = 5.9 \u00d7 103 59000 =5.9 \u00d7 10000 = 5.9 \u00d7 104 and so on. TRY THESE Expand by expressing powers of 10 in the exponential form: (i) 172 (ii) 5,643 (iii) 56,439 (iv) 1,76,428 2024-25",
            "Page14": "EXPONENTS AND POWERS 183 We have expressed all these numbers in the standard form. Any number can be expressed as a decimal number between 1.0 and 10.0 including 1.0 multiplied by a power of 10. Such a form of a number is called its standard form. Thus, 5,985 = 5.985 \u00d7 1,000 = 5.985 \u00d7 103 is the standard form of 5,985. Note, 5,985 can also be expressed as 59.85 \u00d7 100 or 59.85 \u00d7 102. But these are not the standard forms, of 5,985. Similarly, 5,985 = 0.5985 \u00d7 10,000 = 0.5985 \u00d7 104 is also not the standard form of 5,985. We are now ready to express the large numbers we came across at the beginning of the chapter in this form. The, distance of Sun from the centre of our Galaxy i.e., 300,000,000,000,000,000,000 m can be written as 3.0 \u00d7 100,000,000,000,000,000,000 = 3.0 \u00d7 1020 m Now, can you express 40,000,000,000 in the similar way? Count the number of zeros in it. It is 10. So, 40,000,000,000 = 4.0 \u00d7 1010 Mass of the Earth = 5,976,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = 5.976 \u00d7 1024 kg Do you agree with the fact, that the number when written in the standard form is much easier to read, understand and compare than when the number is written with 25 digits? Now, Mass of Uranus = 86,800,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 kg = 8.68 \u00d7 1025 kg Simply by comparing the powers of 10 in the above two, you can tell that the mass of Uranus is greater than that of the Earth. The distance between Sun and Saturn is 1,433,500,000,000 m or 1.4335 \u00d7 1012 m. The distance betwen Saturn and Uranus is 1,439,000,000,000 m or 1.439 \u00d7 1012 m. The distance between Sun and Earth is 149, 600,000,000 m or 1.496 \u00d7 1011m. Can you tell which of the three distances is smallest? EXAMPLE 13Express the following numbers in the standard form: (i) 5985.3 (ii) 65,950 (iii) 3,430,000 (iv) 70,040,000,000 SOLUTION (i) 5985.3 = 5.9853 \u00d7 1000 = 5.9853 \u00d7 103 (ii) 65,950 = 6.595 \u00d7 10,000 = 6.595 \u00d7 104 (iii) 3,430,000 = 3.43 \u00d7 1,000,000 = 3.43 \u00d7 106 (iv) 70,040,000,000 = 7.004 \u00d7 10,000,000,000 = 7.004 \u00d7 1010 2024-25",
            "Page15": "MATHEMATICS 184 A point to remember is that one less than the digit count (number of digits) to the left of the decimal point in a given number is the exponent of 10 in the standard form. Thus, in 70,040,000,000 there is no decimal point shown; we assume it to be at the (right) end. From there, the count of the places (digits) to the left is 11. The exponent of 10 in the standard form is 11 \u2013 1 = 10. In 5985.3 there are 4 digits to the left of the decimal point and hence the exponent of 10 in the standard form is 4 \u2013 1 = 3.

            "Page1": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 59 4.1 A MIND-READING GAME! The teacher has said that she would be starting a new chapter in mathematics and it is going to be simple equations. Appu, Sarita and Ameena have revised what they learnt in algebra chapter in Class VI. Have you? Appu, Sarita and Ameena are excited because they have constructed a game which they call mind reader and they want to present it to the whole class. The teacher appreciates their enthusiasm and invites them to present their game. Ameena begins; she asks Sara to think of a number, multiply it by 4 and add 5 to the product. Then, she asks Sara to tell the result. She says it is 65. Ameena instantly declares that the number Sara had thought of is 15. Sara nods. The whole class including Sara is surprised. It is Appu\u2019s turn now. He asks Balu to think of a number, multiply it by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. He then asks Balu what his result is? Balu says it is 50. Appu immediately tells the number thought by Balu. It is 7, Balu confirms it. Everybody wants to know how the \u2018mind reader\u2019 presented by Appu, Sarita and Ameena works. Can you see how it works? After studying this chapter and chapter 12, you will very well know how the game works. 4.2 SETTING UP OF AN EQUATION Let us take Ameena\u2019s example. Ameena asks Sara to think of a number. Ameena does not know the number. For her, it could be anything 1, 2, 3, . . ., 11, . . . , 100, . . . . Let us denote this unknown number by a letter, say x. You may use y or t or some other letter in place of x. It does not matter which letter we use to denote the unknown number Sara has thought of. When Sara multiplies the number by 4, she gets 4x. She then adds 5 to the product, which gives 4x + 5. The value of (4x + 5) depends on the value of x. Thus if x = 1, 4x + 5 = 4 \u00d71 + 5 = 9. This means that if Sara had 1 in her mind, her result would have been 9. Similarly, if she thought of 5, then for x = 5, 4x + 5 = 4 \u00d7 5 + 5 = 25; Thus if Sara had chosen 5, the result would have been 25. Chapter 4 Simple Equations 2024-25",
            "Page2": "MATHEMATICS 60 To find the number thought by Sara let us work backward from her answer 65. We have to find x such that 4x + 5 = 65 (4.1) Solution to the equation will give us the number which Sara held in her mind. Let us similarly look at Appu\u2019s example. Let us call the number Balu chose as y. Appu asks Balu to multiply the number by 10 and subtract 20 from the product. That is, from y, Balu first gets 10y and from there (10y \u2013 20). The result is known to be 50. Therefore, 10y \u2013 20 = 50 (4.2) The solution of this equation will give us the number Balu had thought of. 4.3 REVIEW OF WHAT WE KNOW Note, (4.1) and (4.2) are equations. Let us recall what we learnt about equations in Class VI. An equation is a condition on a variable. In equation (4.1), the variable is x; in equation (4.2), the variable is y. The word variable means something that can vary, i.e. change. A variable takes on different numerical values; its value is not fixed. Variables are denoted usually by letters of the alphabets, such as x, y, z, l, m, n, p, etc. From variables, we form expressions. The expressions are formed by performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables. From x, we formed the expression (4x + 5). For this, first we multiplied x by 4 and then added 5 to the product. Similarly, from y, we formed the expression (10y \u2013 20). For this, we multiplied y by 10 and then subtracted 20 from the product. All these are examples of expressions. The value of an expression thus formed depends upon the chosen value of the variable. As we have already seen, when x = 1, 4x + 5 = 9; when x = 5, 4x + 5 = 25. Similarly, when x = 15, 4 x + 5 = 4\u00d715 + 5 = 65; when x = 0, 4 x + 5 = 4 \u00d7 0 + 5 = 5; and so on. Equation (4.1) is a condition on the variable x. It states that the value of the expression (4x + 5) is 65. The condition is satisfied when x = 15. It is the solution to the equation 4x + 5 = 65. When x = 5, 4x + 5 = 25 and not 65. Thus x = 5 is not a solution to the equation. Similarly, x = 0 is not a solution to the equation. No value of x other than 15 satisfies the condition 4x + 5 = 65. The value of the expression (10y \u2013 20) depends on the value of y. Verify this by giving five different values to y and finding for each y the value of (10 y \u2013 20). From the different values of (10y \u2013 20) you obtain, do you see a solution to 10y \u2013 20 = 50? If there is no solution, try giving more values to y and find whether the condition 10y \u2013 20 = 50 is met. TRY THESE 2024-25",
            "Page3": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 61 4.4 WHAT EQUATION IS? In an equation there is always an equality sign. The equality sign shows that the value of the expression to the left of the sign (the left hand side or LHS) is equal to the value of the expression to the right of the sign (the right hand side or RHS). In equation (4.1), the LHS is (4x + 5) and the RHS is 65. In equation (4.2), the LHS is (10y \u2013 20) and the RHS is 50. If there is some sign other than the equality sign between the LHS and the RHS, it is not an equation. Thus, 4x + 5 > 65 is not an equation. It says that, the value of (4x + 5) is greater than 65. Similarly, 4x + 5 < 65 is not an equation. It says that the value of (4x + 5) is smaller than 65. In equations, we often find that the RHS is just a number. In Equation (4.1), it is 65 and in equation (4.2), it is 50. But this need not be always so. The RHS of an equation may be an expression containing the variable. For example, the equation 4x + 5 = 6x \u2013 25 has the expression (4x + 5) on the left and (6x \u2013 25) on the right of the equality sign. In short, an equation is a condition on a variable. The condition is that two expressions should have equal value. Note that at least one of the two expressions must contain the variable. We also note a simple and useful property of equations. The equation 4x +5 = 65 is the same as 65 = 4x + 5. Similarly, the equation 6x \u2013 25 = 4x +5 is the same as 4x + 5 = 6x \u2013 25. An equation remains the same, when the expressions on the left and on the right are interchanged. This property is often useful in solving equations. EXAMPLE 1 Write the following statements in the form of equations: (i) The sum of three times x and 11 is 32. (ii) If you subtract 5 from 6 times a number, you get 7. (iii) One fourth of m is 3 more than 7. (iv) One third of a number plus 5 is 8. SOLUTION (i) Three times x is 3x. Sum of 3x and 11 is 3x + 11. The sum is 32. The equation is 3x + 11 = 32. (ii) Let us say the number is z; z multiplied by 6 is 6z. Subtracting 5 from 6z, one gets 6z \u2013 5. The result is 7. The equation is 6z \u2013 5 = 7 2024-25",
            "Page4": "MATHEMATICS 62 (iii) One fourth of m is m 4 . It is greater than 7 by 3. This means the difference ( m 4 \u20137) is 3. The equation is m 4 \u2013 7 = 3. (iv) Take the number to be n. One third of n is n 3 . This one-third plus 5 is n 3 + 5. It is 8. The equation is n 3 + 5 = 8.

(ii) Five times a number p is 20. (iii) Add 7 to three times n to get 1. (iv) You get 6, when you subtract 2 from one-fifth of a number m. What is important to note is that for a given equation, not just one, but many statement forms can be given. For example, for Equation (i) above, you can say: Subtract 5 from x, you get 9. or The number x is 5 more than 9. or The number x is greater by 5 than 9. or The difference between x and 5 is 9, and so on.

Set up an equation to find Raju\u2019s age. SOLUTION We do not know Raju\u2019s age. Let us take it to be y years. Three times Raju\u2019s age is 3y years. Raju\u2019s father\u2019s age is 5 years more than 3y; that is, Raju\u2019s father is (3y + 5) years old. It is also given that Raju\u2019s father is 44 years old. Therefore, 3y + 5 = 44 (4.3) This is an equation in y. It will give Raju\u2019s age when solved. EXAMPLE 4A shopkeeper sells mangoes in two types of boxes, one small and one large. A large box contains as many as 8 small boxes plus 4 loose mangoes. Set up an equation which gives the number of mangoes in each small box. The number of mangoes in a large box is given to be 100. SOLUTION Let a small box contain m mangoes. A large box contains 4 more than 8 times m, that is, 8m + 4 mangoes. But this is given to be 100. Thus 8m + 4 = 100 (4.4) You can get the number of mangoes in a small box by solving this equation. Write atleast one other form for each equation (ii), (iii) and (iv). TRY THESE 2024-25",

Again the equality holds (i.e., its LHS and RHS are equal). Thus if we add the same number to both sides of an equality, it still holds. l Let us now subtract 2 from both the sides; as a result, LHS = 8 \u2013 3 \u2013 2 = 5 \u2013 2 = 3 RHS = 4 + 1 \u2013 2 = 5 \u2013 2 = 3. Again, the equality holds. Thus if we subtract the same number from both sides of an equality, it still holds. l Similarly, if we multiply or divide both sides of the equality by the same non-zero number, it still holds. For example, let us multiply both the sides of the equality by 3, we get LHS = 3 \u00d7 (8 \u2013 3) = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15, RHS = 3 \u00d7 (4 + 1) = 3 \u00d7 5 = 15. The equality holds. Let us now divide both sides of the equality by 2. LHS = (8 \u2013 3) \u00f7 2 = 5 \u00f7 2 = 5 2 RHS = (4+1) \u00f7 2 = 5 \u00f7 2 = 5 2 = LHS Again, the equality holds. If we take any other equality, we shall find the same conclusions. Suppose, we do not observe these rules. Specificially, suppose we add different numbers, to the two sides of an equality. We shall find in this case that the equality does not 2024-25",
            "Page7": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 65 hold (i.e., its both sides are not equal). For example, let us take again equality (4.5), 8 \u2013 3 = 4 + 1 add 2 to the LHS and 3 to the RHS. The new LHS is 8 \u2013 3 + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7 and the new RHS is 4 + 1 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8. The equality does not hold, because the new LHS and RHS are not equal. Thus if we fail to do the same mathematical operation with same number on both sides of an equality, the equality may not hold. The equality that involves variables is an equation. These conclusions are also valid for equations, as in each equation variable represents a number only. Often an equation is said to be like a weighing balance. Doing a mathematical operation on an equation is like adding weights to or removing weights from the pans of a weighing balance. An equation is like a weighing balance with equal weights on both its pans, in which case the arm of the balance is exactly horizontal. If we add the same weights to both the pans, the arm remains horizontal. Similarly, if we remove the same weights from both the pans, the arm remains horizontal. On the other hand if we add different weights to the pans or remove different weights from them, the balance is tilted; that is, the arm of the balance does not remain horizontal. We use this principle for solving an equation. Here, ofcourse, the balance is imaginary and numbers can be used as weights that can be physically balanced against each other. This is the real purpose in presenting the principle. Let us take some examples. l Consider the equation: x + 3 = 8 (4.6) We shall subtract 3 from both sides of this equation. The new LHS is x + 3 \u2013 3 = x and the new RHS is8 \u2013 3 = 5 Since this does not disturb the balance, we have New LHS = New RHS or x = 5 which is exactly what we want, the solution of the equation (4.6). A balanced equation is like a weighing balance with equal weights in the two pans. L.H.S. R.H.S. Why should we subtract 3, and not some other number? Try adding 3. Will it help? Why not? It is because subtracting 3 reduces the LHS to x. 2024-25",
            "Page8": "MATHEMATICS 66 To confirm whether we are right, we shall put x = 5 in the original equation. We get LHS = x + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8, which is equal to the RHS as required. By doing the right mathematical operation (i.e., subtracting 3) on both the sides of the equation, we arrived at the solution of the equation. l Let us look at another equation x \u2013 3 = 10 (4.7) What should we do here? We should add 3 to both the sides, By doing so, we shall retain the balance and also the LHS will reduce to just x. New LHS = x \u2013 3 + 3 = x , New RHS = 10 + 3 = 13 Therefore, x = 13, which is the required solution. By putting x = 13 in the original equation (4.7) we confirm that the solution is correct: LHS of original equation = x \u2013 3 = 13 \u2013 3 = 10 This is equal to the RHS as required. l Similarly, let us look at the equations 5y = 35 (4.8) m 2 = 5 (4.9) In the first case, we shall divide both the sides by 5. This will give us just y on LHS New LHS = 5 5 5 5 y y y = \u00d7 = , New RHS = 35 5 5 7 5 7 = \u00d7 = Therefore, y = 7 This is the required solution. We can substitute y = 7 in Eq. (4.8) and check that it is satisfied. In the second case, we shall multiply both sides by 2. This will give us just m on the LHS The new LHS = m 2 2 \u00d7 = m. The new RHS = 5 \u00d7 2 = 10. Hence, m = 10 (It is the required solution. You can check whether the solution is correct). One can see that in the above examples, the operation we need to perform depends on the equation. Our attempt should be to get the variable in the equation separated. Sometimes, for doing so we may have to carry out more than one mathematical operation. Let us solve some more equations with this in mind. EXAMPLE 5Solve: (a) 3n + 7 = 25 (4.10) (b) 2p \u2013 1 = 23 (4.11) SOLUTION (a) We go stepwise to separate the variable n on the LHS of the equation. The LHS is 3n + 7. We shall first subtract 7 from it so that we get 3n. From this, in the next step we shall divide by 3 to get n. Remember we must do the same operation on both sides of the equation. Therefore, subtracting 7 from both sides, 3n + 7 \u2013 7 = 25 \u2013 7 (Step 1) or 3n = 18 2024-25",
            "Page9": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 67 Now divide both sides by 3, 3 3 n = 18 3 (Step 2) or n = 6, which is the solution. (b) What should we do here? First we shall add 1 to both the sides: 2p \u2013 1 + 1 = 23 + 1 (Step 1) or 2p = 24 Now divide both sides by 2, we get 2 2 24 2 p = (Step 2) or p = 12, which is the solution. One good practice you should develop is to check the solution you have obtained. Although we have not done this for (a) above, let us do it for this example. Let us put the solution p = 12 back into the equation. LHS = 2p \u2013 1 = 2 \u00d7 12 \u2013 1 = 24 \u2013 1 = 23 = RHS The solution is thus checked for its correctness. Why do you not check the solution of (a) also? We are now in a position to go back to the mind-reading game presented by Appu, Sarita, and Ameena and understand how they got their answers. For this purpose, let us look at the equations (4.1) and (4.2) which correspond respectively to Ameena\u2019s and Appu\u2019s examples. l First consider the equation 4x + 5 = 65. (4.1) Subtracting 5 from both sides, 4x + 5 \u2013 5 = 65 \u2013 5. i.e. 4x = 60 Divide both sides by 4; this will separate x. We get 4 4 x = 60 4 or x = 15, which is the solution. (Check, if it is correct.) l Now consider,10y \u2013 20 = 50 (4.2) Adding 20 to both sides, we get 10y \u2013 20 + 20 = 50 + 20 or 10y = 70 Dividing both sides by 10, we get 10 10 y = 70 10 or y = 7, which is the solution. (Check if it is correct.) You will realise that exactly these were the answers given by Appu, Sarita and Ameena. They had learnt to set up equations and solve them. That is why they could construct their mind reader game and impress the whole class. We shall come back to this in Section 4.7. 2024-25",

While trans- posing a number, we change its sign. 2024-25",
            "Page11": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 69 As we have seen, while solving equations one commonly used operation is adding or subtracting the same number on both sides of the equation. Transposing a number (i.e., changing the side of the number) is the same as adding or subtracting the number from both sides. In doing so, the sign of the number has to be changed. What applies to numbers also applies to expressions. Let us take two more examples of transposing. Adding or Subtracting Transposing on both sides (i) 3p \u2013 10 = 5 (i) 3p \u2013 10 = 5 Add 10 to both sides Transpose (\u201310) from LHS to RHS 3p \u2013 10 + 10 = 5 + 10 (On transposing \u2013 10 becomes + 10). or 3p = 15 3p = 5 + 10 or 3p = 15 (ii) 5x + 12 = 27 (ii) 5x + 12 = 27 Subtract 12 from both sides Transposing + 12 (On transposing + 12 becomes \u2013 12) 5x + 12 \u2013 12 = 27 \u2013 12 5x = 27 \u2013 12 or 5x = 15 or 5x = 15 We shall now solve two more equations. As you can see they involve brackets, which have to be solved before proceeding. EXAMPLE 7Solve (a) 4(m + 3) = 18 (b) \u2013 2(x + 3) = 8 SOLUTION (a) 4(m + 3) = 18 Let us divide both the sides by 4. This will remove the brackets in the LHS We get, m + = 3 18 4 or m + = 3 9 2 or m = 9 2 \u20133 (transposing 3 to RHS) or m = 3 2 (required solution) as 9 2 3 9 2 6 2 3 2 \u2212 = \u2212 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 Check LHS = 4 3 2 3 4 3 2 4 3 2 3 4 3 + \uf8ee \uf8f0 \uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb \uf8fa= \u00d7 + \u00d7 = \u00d7 + \u00d7 [put m = 3 2 ] = 6 + 12 = 18 = RHS (b) \u20132(x + 3) = 8 We divide both sides by (\u2013 2), so as to remove the brackets in the LHS, we get, x + 3 = \u2013 8 2 or x + 3 = \u2013 4 i.e., x = \u2013 4 \u2013 3 (transposing 3 to RHS) or x = \u20137 (required solution) 2024-25",

We also have learnt how to solve simple equations. Thus we are ready to solve puzzles/problems from practical situations. The method is first to form equations corresponding to such situations and then to solve those equations to give the solution to the puzzles/problems. We begin with what we have already seen [Example 1 (i) and (iii), Section 4.2]. EXAMPLE 8The sum of three times a number and 11 is 32. Find the number. SOLUTION l If the unknown number is taken to be x, then three times the number is 3x and the sum of 3x and 11 is 32. That is, 3x + 11 = 32 l To solve this equation, we transpose 11 to RHS, so that 3x = 32 \u2013 11 or 3x = 21 Now, divide both sides by 3 So x = 21 3 = 7 The required number is 7. (We may check it by taking 3 times 7 and adding 11 to it. It gives 32 as required.) EXAMPLE 9Find a number, such that one-fourth of the number is 3 more than 7. This equation was obtained earlier in Section 4.2, Example 1. SOLUTION l Let us take the unknown number to be y; one-fourth of y is y 4 . This number y 4 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 is more than 7 by 3. Hence we get the equation for y as y 4 \u2013 7 = 3 l To solve this equation, first transpose 7 to RHS We get, y 4 = 3 + 7 = 10. We then multiply both sides of the equation by 4, to get y 4 \u00d7 4 = 10 \u00d7 4 or y = 40 (the required number) TRY THESE (i) When you multiply a number by 6 and subtract 5 from the product, you get 7. Can you tell what the number is? (ii) What is that num- ber one third of which added to 5 gives 8? 2024-25",
            "Page13": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 71 Let us check the equation formed. Putting the value of y in the equation, LHS = 40 4 \u2013 7 = 10 \u2013 7 = 3 = RHS, as required.

SOLUTION l As given in Example 3 earlier, the equation that gives Raju's age is 3y + 5 = 44 l To solve it, we first transpose 5, to get 3y = 44 \u2013 5 = 39 Dividing both sides by 3, we get y = 13 That is, Raju\u2019s age is 13 years. (You may check the answer.) TRY THESE There are two types of boxes containing mangoes. Each box of the larger type contains 4 more mangoes than the number of mangoes contained in 8 boxes of the smaller type. Each larger box contains 100 mangoes.

To reach a triple century You still need forty! WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? 1. An equation is a condition on a variable such that two expressions in the variable should have equal value. 2. The value of the variable for which the equation is satisfied is called the solution of the equation. 3. An equation remains the same if the LHS and the RHS are interchanged. 4. In case of the balanced equation, if we (i) add the same number to both the sides, or (ii) subtract the same number from both the sides, or (iii) multiply both sides by the same number, or (iv) divide both sides by the same number, the balance remains undisturbed, i.e., the value of the LHS remains equal to the value of the RHS 5. The above property gives a systematic method of solving an equation. We carry out a series of identical mathematical operations on the two sides of the equation in such a way that on one of the sides we get just the variable. The last step is the solution of the equation. 2024-25",
            "Page15": "SIMPLE EQUATIONS 73 6. Transposing means moving to the other side. Transposition of a number has the same effect as adding same number to (or subtracting the same number from) both sides of the equation. When you transpose a number from one side of the equation to the other side, you change its sign. For example, transposing +3 from the LHS to the RHS in equation x + 3 = 8 gives x = 8 \u2013 3 (= 5). We can carry out the transposition of an expression in the same way as the transposition of a number. 7. We also learnt how, using the technique of doing the same mathematical operation (for example adding the same number) on both sides, we could build an equation starting from its solution. Further, we also learnt that we could relate a given equation to some appropriate practical situation and build a practical word problem/puzzle from the equation. 2024-25"

Can you identify the different line segments and angles formed in the following figures? (Fig 5.1) (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) Fig 5.1 Can you also identify whether the angles made are acute or obtuse or right? Recall that a line segment has two end points. If we extend the two end points in either direction endlessly, we get a line. Thus, we can say that a line has no end points. On the other hand, recall that a ray has one end point (namely its starting point). For example, look at the figures given below: Fig 5.2 Here, Fig 5.2 (i) shows a line segment, Fig 5.2 (ii) shows a line and Fig 5.2 (iii) is that of a ray. A line segment PQ is generally denoted by the symbol PQ, a line AB is denoted by the symbol AB \u0001\u0002\u0002 \u0003 and the ray OP is denoted by OP u r u u .

These corners are formed when two lines or line segments intersect at a point.

Whereas, in Fig 5.3 (ii) lines PQ and RS intersect at O to form four angles POS, SOQ, QOR and ROP. An angle ABC is represented by the symbol \u2220ABC. Thus, in Fig 5.3 (i), the three angles formed are \u2220ABC, \u2220BCA and \u2220BAC, and in Fig 5.3 (ii), the four angles formed are \u2220POS, \u2220SOQ, \u2220QOR and \u2220POR.

In Class VI, we have seen how these expressions are useful in formu- lating puzzles and problems. We have also seen examples of several expressions in the chapter on simple equations. Expressions are a central concept in algebra. This Chapter is devoted to algebraic expressions. When you have studied this Chapter, you will know how algebraic expressions are formed, how they can be combined, how we can find their values and how they can be used. 10.2 HOW ARE EXPRESSIONS FORMED? We now know very well what a variable is. We use letters x, y, l, m, ... etc. to denote variables. A variable can take various values. Its value is not fixed. On the other hand, a constant has a fixed value. Examples of constants are: 4, 100, \u201317, etc. We combine variables and constants to make algebraic expressions. For this, we use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. We have already come across expressions like 4x + 5, 10y \u2013 20. The expression 4x + 5 is obtained from the variable x, first by multiplying x by the constant 4 and then adding the constant 5 to the product. Similarly, 10y \u2013 20 is obtained by first multiplying y by 10 and then subtracting 20 from the product. The above expressions were obtained by combining variables with constants. We can also obtain expressions by combining variables with themselves or with other variables. Look at how the following expressions are obtained: x2, 2y2, 3x2 \u2013 5, xy, 4xy + 7 (i) The expression x2 is obtained by multiplying the variable x by itself; x \u00d7 x = x2 Just as 4 \u00d7 4 is written as 42, we write x \u00d7 x = x2. It is commonly read as x squared. Chapter 10 2024-25",
            "Page2": "ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS 161 (Later, when you study the chapter \u2018Exponents and Powers\u2019 you will realise that x2 may also be read as x raised to the power 2). In the same manner, we can write x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x = x3 Commonly, x3 is read as \u2018x cubed\u2019. Later, you will realise that x3 may also be read as x raised to the power 3. x, x2, x3, ... are all algebraic expressions obtained from x. (ii) The expression 2y2 is obtained from y: 2y2 = 2 \u00d7 y \u00d7 y Here by multiplying y with y we obtain y2 and then we multiply y2 by the constant 2. (iii) In (3x2 \u2013 5) we first obtain x2, and multiply it by 3 to get 3x2. From 3x2, we subtract 5 to finally arrive at 3x2 \u2013 5. (iv) In xy, we multiply the variable x with another variable y. Thus, x \u00d7 y = xy. (v) In 4xy + 7, we first obtain xy, multiply it by 4 to get 4xy and add 7 to 4xy to get the expression. 10.3 TERMS OF AN EXPRESSION We shall now put in a systematic form what we have learnt above about how expressions are formed. For this purpose, we need to understand what terms of an expression and their factors are. Consider the expression (4x + 5). In forming this expression, we first formed 4x separately as a product of 4 and x and then added 5 to it. Similarly consider the expression (3x2 + 7y). Here we first formed 3x2 separately as a product of 3, x and x. We then formed 7y separately as a product of 7 and y. Having formed 3x2 and 7y separately, we added them to get the expression. You will find that the expressions we deal with can always be seen this way. They have parts which are formed separately and then added. Such parts of an expression which are formed separately first and then added are known as terms. Look at the expression (4x2 \u2013 3xy). We say that it has two terms, 4x2 and \u20133xy. The term 4x2 is a product of 4, x and x, and the term (\u20133xy) is a product of (\u20133), x and y. Terms are added to form expressions. Just as the terms 4x and 5 are added to form the expression (4x + 5), the terms 4x2 and (\u20133xy) are added to give the expression (4x2 \u2013 3xy). This is because 4x2 + (\u20133xy) = 4x2 \u2013 3xy. Note, the minus sign (\u2013) is included in the term. In the expression 4x2 \u20133xy, we took the term as (\u20133xy) and not as (3xy). That is why we do not need to say that terms are \u2018added or subtracted\u2019 to form an expression; just \u2018added\u2019 is enough. Factors of a term We saw above that the expression (4x2 \u2013 3xy) consists of two terms 4x2 and \u20133xy. The term 4x2 is a product of 4, x and x; we say that 4, x and x are the factors of the term 4x2. A term is a product of its factors. The term \u20133xy is a product of the factors \u20133, x and y. Describe how the following expressions are obtained: 7xy + 5, x2y, 4x2 \u2013 5x TRY THESE 2024-25",
            "Page3": "MATHEMATICS 162 We can represent the terms and factors of the terms of an expression conveniently and elegantly by a tree diagram. The tree for the expression (4x2 \u2013 3xy) is as shown in the adjacent figure. Note, in the tree diagram, we have used dotted lines for factors and continuous lines for terms. This is to avoid mixing them. Let us draw a tree diagram for the expression 5xy + 10. The factors are such that they cannot be further factorised. Thus we do not write 5xy as 5 \u00d7 xy, because xy can be further factorised. Similarly, if x3 were a term, it would be written as x \u00d7 x \u00d7 x and not x2 \u00d7 x. Also, remember that 1 is not taken as a separate factor. Coefficients We have learnt how to write a term as a product of factors. One of these factors may be numerical and the others algebraic (i.e., they contain variables). The numerical factor is said to be the numerical coefficient or simply the coefficient of the term. It is also said to be the coefficient of the rest of the term (which is obviously the product of algebraic factors of the term). Thus in 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of the term. It is also the coefficient of xy. In the term 10xyz, 10 is the coefficient of xyz, in the term \u20137x2y2, \u20137 is the coefficient of x2y2. When the coefficient of a term is +1, it is usually omitted. For example, 1x is written as x; 1 x2y2 is written as x2y2 and so on. Also, the coefficient (\u20131) is indicated only by the minus sign. Thus (\u20131) x is written as \u2013 x; (\u20131) x 2 y 2 is written as \u2013 x2 y2 and so on. Sometimes, the word \u2018coefficient\u2019 is used in a more general way. Thus we say that in the term 5xy, 5 is the coefficient of xy, x is the coefficient of 5y and y is the coefficient of 5x. In 10xy2, 10 is the coefficient of xy2, x is the coefficient of 10y2 and y2 is the coefficient of 10x. Thus, in this more general way, a coefficient may be either a numerical factor or an algebraic factor or a product of two or more factors. It is said to be the coefficient of the product of the remaining factors. EXAMPLE 1 Identify, in the following expressions, terms which are not constants.

When terms have different algebraic factors, they are unlike terms. For example, in the expression 2xy \u2013 3x + 5xy \u2013 4, look at the terms 2xy and 5xy. The factors of 2xy are 2, x and y. The factors of 5xy are 5, x and y. Thus their algebraic (i.e., those which contain variables) factors are the same and 2024-25",
            "Page5": "MATHEMATICS 164 hence they are like terms. On the other hand the terms 2xy and \u20133x, have different algebraic factors. They are unlike terms. Similarly, the terms, 2xy and 4, are unlike terms. Also, the terms \u20133x and 4 are unlike terms. 10.5 MONOMIALS, BINOMIALS, TRINOMIALS AND POLYNOMIALS An expression with only one term is called a monomial; for example, 7xy, \u2013 5m, 3z2, 4 etc. An expression which contains two unlike terms is called a binomial; for example, x + y, m \u2013 5, mn + 4m, a2 \u2013 b2 are binomials. The expression 10pq is not a binomial; it is a monomial. The expression (a + b + 5) is not a binomial. It contains three terms. An expression which contains three terms is called a trinomial; for example, the expressions x + y + 7, ab + a +b, 3x2 \u2013 5x + 2, m + n + 10 are trinomials. The expression ab + a + b + 5 is, however not a trinomial; it contains four terms and not three. The expression x + y + 5x is not a trinomial as the terms x and 5x are like terms. In general, an expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Thus a monomial, a binomial and a trinomial are all polynomials.

There are a number of situations in which we need to find the value of an expression, such as when we wish to check whether a particular value of a variable satisfies a given equation or not. We find values of expressions, also, when we use formulas from geometry and from everyday mathematics. For example, the area of a square is l2, where l is the length of a side of the square. If l = 5 cm., the area is 52 cm2 or 25 cm2; if the side is 10 cm, the area is 102 cm2 or 100 cm2 and so on. We shall see more such examples in the next section. 2024-25",

We use the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on the variables and constants to form expressions. For example, the expression 4xy + 7 is formed from the variables x and y and constants 4 and 7. The constant 4 and the variables x and y are multiplied to give the product 4xy and the constant 7 is added to this product to give the expression. 2. Expressions are made up of terms. Terms are added to make an expression. For example, the addition of the terms 4xy and 7 gives the expression 4xy + 7. 3. A term is a product of factors. The term 4xy in the expression 4xy + 7 is a product of factors x, y and 4. Factors containing variables are said to be algebraic factors. 4. The coefficient is the numerical factor in the term. Sometimes anyone factor in a term is called the coefficient of the remaining part of the term. 5. Any expression with one or more terms is called a polynomial. Specifically a one term expression is called a monomial; a two-term expression is called a binomial; and a three-term expression is called a trinomial. 6. Terms which have the same algebraic factors are like terms. Terms which have different algebraic factors are unlike terms. Thus, terms 4xy and \u2013 3xy are like terms; but terms 4xy and \u2013 3x are not like terms. 7. In situations such as solving an equation and using a formula, we have to find the value of an expression. The value of the expression depends on the value of the variable from which the expression is formed. Thus, the value of 7x \u2013 3 for x = 5 is 32, since 7(5) \u2013 3 = 35 \u2013 3 = 32. 2024-25"

She can, for example, walk first along AB and then along BC to reach C; or she can walk straight along AC. She will naturally prefer the direct path AC. If she takes the other path (ABand then BC ), she will have to walk more. In other words, AB + BC > AC (i) Similarly, if one were to start from B and go to A, he or she will not take the route BC and CA but will prefer BA This is because BC + CA > AB (ii) By a similar argument, you find that CA + AB > BC (iii) These observations suggest that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the third side. 2.

Is the sum of any two angles of a triangle always greater than the third angle? 6.8 RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES AND PYTHAGORAS PROPERT Y Pythagoras, a Greek philosopher of sixth century B.C. is said to have found a very important and useful property of right-angled triangles given in this section. The property is, hence, named after him. In fact, this property was known to people of many other countries too. The Indian mathematician Baudhayan has also given an equivalent form of this property. We now try to explain the Pythagoras property. In a right-angled triangle, the sides have some special names. The side opposite to the right angle is called the hypotenuse; the other two sides are known as the legs of the right-angled triangle. In \u2206ABC (Fig 6.23), the right-angle is at B. So, AC is the hypotenuse. AB and BC are the legs of \u2206ABC. Make eight identical copies of right angled triangle of any size you prefer. For example, you make a right-angled triangle whose hypotenuse is a units long and the legs are of lengths b units and c units (Fig 6.24). Draw two identical squares on a sheet with sides of lengths b + c. You are to place four triangles in one square and the remaining four triangles in the other square, as shown in the following diagram (Fig 6.25). Fig 6.23 Fig 6.24 Fig 6.25 Square A Square B 2024-25",
            "Page16": "THE TRIANGLE AND ITS PROPERTIES 103 The squares are identical; the eight triangles inserted are also identical. Hence the uncovered area of square A = Uncovered area of square B. i.e., Area of inner square of square A = The total area of two uncovered squares in square B. a2 = b2 + c2 This is Pythagoras property. It may be stated as follows: In a right-angled triangle, the square on the hypotenuse = sum of the squares on the legs. Pythagoras property is a very useful tool in mathematics. It is formally proved as a theorem in later classes. You should be clear about its meaning. It says that for any right-angled triangle, the area of the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares on the legs. Draw a right triangle, preferably on a square sheet, construct squares on its sides, compute the area of these squares and verify the theorem practically (Fig 6.26). If you have a right-angled triangle, the Pythagoras property holds. If the Pythagoras property holds for some triangle, will the triangle be right- angled? (Such problems are known as converse problems). We will try to answer this. Now, we will show that, if there is a triangle such that sum of the squares on two of its sides is equal to the square of the third side, it must be a right-angled triangle. Fig 6.26 DO THIS 5 2 6 2 4 2 5 6 4 Fig 6.27 1. Have cut-outs of squares with sides 4 cm, 5 cm, 6 cm long. Arrange to get a triangular shape by placing the corners of the squares suitably as shown in the figure (Fig 6.27). Trace out the triangle formed. Measure each angle of the triangle. You find that there is no right angle at all. In fact, in this case each angle will be acute! Note that 42 + 52 \u2260 62, 52 + 62 \u2260 42 and 62 + 42 \u2260 52. 2024-25",

Note that 42 + 52 \u226072 etc. This shows that Pythagoras property holds if and only if the triangle is right-angled. Hence we get this fact: If the Pythagoras property holds, the triangle must be right-angled. EXAMPLE 5Determine whether the triangle whose lengths of sides are 3 cm, 4 cm, 5 cm is a right-angled triangle. SOLUTION 32 = 3 \u00d7 3 = 9; 42 = 4 \u00d7 4 = 16; 52 = 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 We find 32 + 42 = 52. Therefore, the triangle is right-angled. Note: In any right-angled triangle, the hypotenuse happens to be the longest side. In this example, the side with length 5 cm is the hypotenuse. EXAMPLE 6 \u2206 ABC is right-angled at C. If AC = 5 cm and BC = 12 cm find the length of AB. SOLUTION A rough figure will help us (Fig 6.28). By Pythagoras property, AB2 = AC2 + BC2 = 52 + 122 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132 or AB2 = 132.

Property of the lengths of sides of a triangle: The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. The difference between the lengths of any two sides is smaller than the length of the third side. DO THIS 2024-25",

In this case we need to know the area of the triangular region. Let us find a method to get the area of a triangle. Draw a scalene triangle on a piece of paper. Cut out the triangle. Place this triangle on another piece of paper and cut out another triangle of the same size. So now you have two scalene triangles of the same size. Are both the triangles congruent? Superpose one triangle on the other so that they match. You may have to rotate one of the two triangles. Now place both the triangles such that a pair of corresponding sides is joined as shown in Fig 9.5. Is the figure thus formed a parallelogram? Compare the area of each triangle to the area of the parallelogram. Compare the base and height of the triangles with the base and height of the parallelogram.

What can you do? Here is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in Fig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the card on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also (Fig 9. 20). Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance along the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along the edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point. You can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and taking all round it. The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference. Take a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference. Now, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method? Still, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular object by measuring through string. Moreover, the measurement will not be accurate. So, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes. Let us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of the circles.

Let us now see how to find the product of two fractions like 1 2 \u00d7 9 4 . To do this we first learn to find the products like 1 2 \u00d7 1 3 . (a) How do we find 1 3 of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of the three parts represents 1 3 of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and shade it as shown in Fig 2.8. (b) How will you find 1 2 of this shaded part? Divide this one-third (1 3 ) shaded part into two equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 1 2 of 1 3 i.e., 1 2 \u00d7 1 3 (Fig 2.9).

The whole was divided in 6 = 2 \u00d7 3 parts and 1 = 1 \u00d7 1 part was taken out of it.

Each of these five equal shapes (Fig 2.10) are parts of five similar circles. Take one such shape. To obtain this shape we first divide a circle in three equal parts. Further divide each of these three parts in two equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent? It will represent 1 2 \u00d7 1 3 = 1 6 .

That is, it represents 1 1 \u00d7 10 10 or 0.1 \u00d7 0.1. Can the dotted square be represented in some other way? How many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14? There are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01. Hence, 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 = 0.01. Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is one digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point. Let us now find 0.2 \u00d7 0.3. We have, 0.2 \u00d7 0.3 = 2 3 \u00d7 10 10 As we did for 1 1 10 10 \u00d7 , let us divide the square into 10 equal parts and take three parts out of it, to get 3 10 .

            "Page17": "MATHEMATICS 36 TRY THESE of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 2 3 \u00d7 10 10 . The dotted squares represent 2 3 \u00d7 10 10 or 0.2 \u00d7 0.3. (Fig 2.15) Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06. Thus, 0.2 \u00d7 0.3 = 0.06. Observe that 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06 is 2 (= 1 + 1). Check whether this applies to 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 also. Find 0.2 \u00d7 0.4 by applying these observations. While finding 0.1 \u00d7 0.1 and 0.2 \u00d7 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 \u00d7 0.1, we found 01 \u00d7 01 or 1 \u00d7 1. Similarly in 0.2 \u00d7 0.3 we found 02 \u00d7 03 or 2 \u00d7 3. Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal numbers that are being multiplied. Let us now find 1.2 \u00d7 2.5. Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right of the decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move towards left. We get 3.00 or 3. Find in a similar way 1.5 \u00d7 1.6, 2.4 \u00d7 4.2. While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from the rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 \u00d7 1.25 = 3.225 Find 2.7 \u00d7 1.35. 1.

Thus, she found that depending on the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with denominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied by 10 or 100 or 1000. Let us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.

Here the numbers are multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 \u00d7 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6. Do you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place. Note that 10 has one zero over 1. In 1.76\u00d7100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two places. Note that 100 has two zeros over one. Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also? 2024-25",

Based on these observations we can now say 0.07 \u00d7 10 = 0.7, 0.07 \u00d7 100 = 7 and 0.07 \u00d7 1000 = 70. Can you now tell 2.97 \u00d7 10 = ? 2.97 \u00d7 100 = ? 2.97 \u00d7 1000 = ?

She needed a few coloured strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm. How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would be 9.5 1.9 cm. Is she correct? Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of decimal numbers too! 2.4.1 Division by 10, 100 and 1000 Let us find the division of a decimal number by 10, 100 and 1000. Consider 31.5 \u00f7 10.

Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000.

In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one zero over 1. Consider now 31.5 \u00f7 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient? It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two zeros over1. So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now quickly find: 2.38 \u00f7 10 = 0.238, 2.38 \u00f7 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 \u00f7 1000 = 0.00238 2.4.2 Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number Let us find 6.4 2 . Remember we also write it as 6.4 \u00f7 2. So, 6.4 \u00f7 2 = 64 10 \u00f7 2 = 64 1 10 2 \u00d7 as learnt in fractions.. = 64 1 10 2 1 64 10 2 1 10 64 2 \u00d7 \u00d7 = \u00d7 \u00d7 = \u00d7 = 1 10 32 32 10 3 2 \u00d7 = = . Or, let us first divide 64 by 2. We get 32. There is one digit to the right of the decimal point in 6.4. Place the decimal in 32 such that there would be one digit to its right. We get 3.2 again. To find 19.5 \u00f7 5, first find 195 \u00f75. We get 39. There is one digit to the right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there would be one digit to its right.

You get 324. There are two digits to the right of the decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you will get 3.24. Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 \u00f7 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves remainder zero. However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 \u00f7 7. We deal with such situations in later classes. EXAMPLE 5 Find the average of 4.2, 3.8 and 7.6.

We have 25.5 \u00f7 0.5 = 255 5 10 10 \u00f7 = 255 10 \u00d7 10 5 = 51. Thus, 25.5 \u00f7 0.5 = 51 What do you observe? For 25.5 0.5 , we find that there is one digit to the right of the decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly 25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10. Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5. So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255. Thus, 22.5 \u00f7 1.5 = 22 5 1 5 . . = 225 15 = 15 Find 20 3 0 7 . . and 15 2 0 8 . . in a similar way.

A vehicle covers a distance of 43.2 km in 2.4 litres of petrol. How much distance will it cover in one litre of petrol? WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED? 1. We have learnt how to multiply fractions. Two fractions are multiplied by multiplying their numerators and denominators seperately and writing the product as productof numerators productof denominators . For example, 2 5 2\u00d75 10 \u00d7 3 7 3\u00d7 7 21 = = . 2. A fraction acts as an operator \u2018of \u2019. For example, 1 2 of 2 is 1 2 \u00d7 2 = 1. 3. (a) The product of two proper fractions is less than each of the fractions that are multiplied. (b) The product of a proper and an improper fraction is less than the improper fraction and greater than the proper fraction. (c) The product of two imporper fractions is greater than the two fractions. 4. A reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting it upside down. 5. We have seen how to divide two fractions. (a) While dividing a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number with the reciprocal of that fraction. For example, 3 5 10 2 2\u00d7 5 3 3 \u00f7 = = (b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the reciprocal of the whole number. For example, 2 2 1 2 7 \u00d7 3 3 7 21 \u00f7 = = (c) While dividing one fraction by another fraction, we multuiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the other. So, 2 5 2 7 14 \u00d7 3 7 3 5 15 \u00f7 = = . 6. We also learnt how to multiply two decimal numbers. While multiplying two decimal numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted. Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place. The count should be the sum obtained earlier. For example, 0.5 \u00d7 0.7 = 0.35 2024-25",
            "Page24": "FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS 43 7. To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Thus 0.53 \u00d7 10 = 5.3, 0.53 \u00d7 100 = 53, 0.53 \u00d7 1000 = 530 8. We have seen how to divide decimal numbers. (a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number. For example, 8.4 \u00f7 4 = 2.1 Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero. (b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the quotient. So, 23.9 \u00f7 10 = 2.39,23.9 \u00f7 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 \u00f7 1000 = 0.0239 (c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then divide. Thus, 2.4 \u00f7 0.2 = 24 \u00f7 2 = 12. 2024-25"

Many more of such statements could be there. Think about the statements given above. Do you think that the child in the first statement studies exactly for 5 hours daily? Or, is the temperature of the given place during that particular time always 40 degrees? Or, is the age of each pupil in that class 12 years? Obviously not. Then what do these statements tell you? By average we understand that Isha, usually, studies for 5 hours. On some days, she may study for less number of hours and on the other days she may study longer. Similarly, the average temperature of 40 degree celsius, means that, very often, the temperature at this time of the year is around 40 degree celsius. Sometimes, it may be less than 40 degree celsius and at other times, it may be more than 40\u00b0C. Thus, we realise that average is a number that represents or shows the central tendency of a group of observations or data. Since average lies between the highest and the lowest value of the given data so, we say average is a measure of the central tendency of the group of data. Different forms of data need different forms of representative or central value to describe it. One of these representative values is the \u201cArithmetic mean\u201d. You will learn about the other representative values in the later part of the chapter. Data Handling Chapter 3 2024-25",
            "Page2": "DATA HANDLING 45 3.2 ARITHMETIC MEAN The most common representative value of a group of data is the arithmetic mean or the mean. To understand this in a better way, let us look at the following example: Two vessels contain 20 litres and 60 litres of milk respectively. What is the amount that each vessel would have, if both share the milk equally? When we ask this question we are seeking the arithmetic mean. In the above case, the average or the arithmetic mean would be Total quantity of milk Number of vessels = 20 60 2 + litres = 40 litres. Thus, each vessels would have 40 litres of milk. The average or Arithmetic Mean (A.M.) or simply mean is defined as follows: mean = Sum of all observations number of observations Consider these examples. EXAMPLE 1Ashish studies for 4 hours, 5 hours and 3 hours respectively on three consecutive days. How many hours does he study daily on an average? SOLUTION The average study time of Ashish would be Total number of study hours Number of days for which he studied = 4 5 3 3 + + hours = 4 hours per day Thus, we can say that Ashish studies for 4 hours daily on an average. EXAMPLE 2 A batsman scored the following number of runs in six innings: 36, 35, 50, 46, 60, 55 Calculate the mean runs scored by him in an inning. SOLUTION Total runs = 36 + 35 + 50 + 46 + 60 + 55 = 282. To find the mean, we find the sum of all the observations and divide it by the number of observations. Therefore, in this case, mean = 282 6 = 47. Thus, the mean runs scored in an inning are 47.

Discuss with your friends. Frame one more example of this type and answer the same questions. You will find that the mean lies inbetween the greatest and the smallest observations. In particular, the mean of two numbers will always lie between the two numbers. For example the mean of 5 and 11 is 5 11 2 8 + = , which lies between 5 and 11. Can you use this idea to show that between any two fractional numbers, you can find as many fractional numbers as you like. For example between 1 2 and 1 4 you have their average 1 2 1 4 2 + = 3 8 and then between 1 2 and 3 8 , you have their average 7 16 and so on. 1.

Following is the record for a week: Size (in inches) 90 cm 95 cm 100 cm 105 cm 110 cm Total Number of Shirts Sold 8 22 32 37 6 105 If he found the mean number of shirts sold, do you think that he would be able to decide which shirt sizes to keep in stock?

He decided to postpone the procurement of the shirts of other sizes because of their small number of buyers. Look at another example The owner of a readymade dress shop says, \u201cThe most popular size of dress I sell is the size 90 cm. Observe that here also, the owner is concerned about the number of shirts of different sizes sold. She is however looking at the shirt size that is sold the most. This is another representative value for the data. The highest occuring event is the sale of size 90 cm.This representative value is called the mode of the data. The mode of a set of observations is the observation that occurs most often. EXAMPLE 4 Find the mode of the given set of numbers: 1, 1, 2, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 2, 4 SOLUTION Arranging the numbers with same values together, we get 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4 Mode of this data is 2 because it occurs more frequently than other observations. 3.3.1 Mode of Large Data Putting the same observations together and counting them is not easy if the number of observations is large. In such cases we tabulate the data. Tabulation can begin by putting tally marks and finding the frequency, as you did in your previous class. Look at the following example: EXAMPLE 5 Following are the margins of victory in the football matches of a league. 1, 3, 2, 5, 1, 4, 6, 2, 5, 2, 2, 2, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 1, 2 Find the mode of this data.

What do we understand by mode here? Whereas mean gives us the average of all observations of the data, the mode gives that observation which occurs most frequently in the data. Let us consider the following examples: (a) You have to decide upon the number of chapattis needed for 25 people called for a feast. (b) A shopkeeper selling shirts has decided to replenish her stock. (c) We need to find the height of the door needed in our house. (d) When going on a picnic, if only one fruit can be bought for everyone, which is the fruit that we would get. In which of these situations can we use the mode as a good estimate? Consider the first statement. Suppose the number of chapattis needed by each person is 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 4, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 4, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 5 DO THIS TRY THESE 2024-25",

If we use mode as the representative value for this data, then we need 50 chapattis only, 2 for each of the 25 persons. However the total number would clearly be inadequate. Would mean be an appropriate representative value? For the third statement the height of the door is related to the height of the persons using that door. Suppose there are 5 children and 4 adults using the door and the height of each of 5 children is around 135 cm. The mode for the heights is 135 cm. Should we get a door that is 144 cm high? Would all the adults be able to go through that door? It is clear that mode is not the appropriate representative value for this data. Would mean be an appropriate representative value here? Why not? Which representative value of height should be used to decide the doorheight? Similarly analyse the rest of the statements and find the representative value useful for that issue. Discuss with your friends and give (a) Two situations where mean would be an appropriate representative value to use, and (b) Two situations where mode would be an appropriate representative value to use. 3.4 MEDIAN We have seen that in some situations, arithmetic mean is an appropriate measure of central tendency whereas in some other situations, mode is the appropriate measure of central tendency. Let us now look at another example. Consider a group of 17 students with the following heights (in cm): 106, 110, 123, 125, 117, 120, 112, 115, 110, 120, 115, 102, 115, 115, 109, 115, 101. The games teacher wants to divide the class into two groups so that each group has equal number of students, one group has students with height lesser than a particular height and the other group has students with heights greater than the particular height. How would she do that? Let us see the various options she has: (i) She can find the mean. The mean is = = 1930 17 113 5 . 106 110 123 125 117 120 112 115 110 120 115 102 115 115 10 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + 9 115 101 17 + + 2024-25",
            "Page9": "MATHEMATICS 52 So, if the teacher divides the students into two groups on the basis of this mean height, such that one group has students of height less than the mean height and the other group has students with height more than the mean height, then the groups would be of unequal size. They would have 7 and 10 members respectively. (ii) The second option for her is to find mode. The observation with highest frequency is 115 cm, which would be taken as mode. There are 7 children below the mode and 10 children at the mode and above the mode. Therefore, we cannot divide the group into equal parts. Let us therefore think of an alternative representative value or measure of central tendency. For doing this we again look at the given heights (in cm) of students and arrange them in ascending order. We have the following observations: 101, 102, 106, 109, 110, 110, 112, 115, 115, 115, 115, 115, 117, 120, 120, 123, 125 The middle value in this data is 115 because this value divides the students into two equal groups of 8 students each. This value is called as Median. Median refers to the value which lies in the middle of the data (when arranged in an increasing or decreasing order) with half of the observations above it and the other half below it. The games teacher decides to keep the middle student as a refree in the game. Here, we consider only those cases where number of observations is odd. Thus, in a given data, arranged in ascending or descending order, the median gives us the middle observation. Note that in general, we may not get the same value for median and mode. Thus we realise that mean, mode and median are the numbers that are the representative values of a group of observations or data. They lie between the minimum and maximum values of the data. They are also called the measures of the central tendency. EXAMPLE 7Find the median of the data: 24, 36, 46, 17, 18, 25, 35 SOLUTION We arrange the data in ascending order, we get 17, 18, 24, 25, 35, 36, 46 Median is the middle observation.

You can look at the bar graphs and make deductions about the data. You can also get information based on these bar graphs. For example, you can say that the mode is the longest bar if the bar represents the frequency. 3.5.1 Choosing a Scale We know that a bar graph is a representation of numbers using bars of uniform width and the lengths of the bars depend upon the frequency and the scale you have chosen. For example, in a bar graph where numbers in units are to be shown, the graph represents one unit length for one observation and if it has to show numbers in tens or hundreds, one unit length can represent 10 or 100 observations. Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 8Two hundred students of 6th and 7th classes were asked to name their favourite colour so as to decide upon what should be the colour of their school building. The results are shown in the following table. Represent the given data on a bar graph. Favourite Colour Red Green Blue Y ellow Orange Number of Students 43 19 55 49 34 Answer the following questions with the help of the bar graph: (i) Which is the most preferred colour and which is the least preferred? (ii) How many colours are there in all? What are they? SOLUTION Choose a suitable scale as follows: Start the scale at 0. The greatest value in the data is 55, so end the scale at a value greater than 55, such as 60. Use equal divisions along the axes, such as increments of 10. You 2024-25",

From the bar graph we conclude that (i) Blue is the most preferred colour (Because the bar representing Blue is the tallest). (ii) Green is the least preferred colour. (Because the bar representing Green is the shortest). (iii) There are five colours. They are Red, Green, Blue, Yellow and Orange.

Is there any pair of integers whose difference is not an integer? Can we say integers are closed under subtraction? Yes, we can see that integers are closed under subtraction. Thus, if a and b are two integers then a \u2013 b is also an intger. Do the whole numbers satisfy this property? 1.1.3 Commutative Property We know that 3 + 5 = 5 + 3 = 8, that is, the whole numbers can be added in any order. In other words, addition is commutative for whole numbers. Can we say the same for integers also? We have 5 + (\u2013 6) = \u20131 and (\u2013 6) + 5 = \u20131 So, 5 + (\u2013 6) = (\u2013 6) + 5 Are the following equal?

Consider the integers 5 and (\u20133). Is 5 \u2013 (\u20133) the same as (\u20133) \u20135? No, because 5 \u2013 ( \u20133) = 5 + 3 = 8, and (\u20133) \u2013 5 = \u2013 3 \u2013 5 = \u2013 8. Take atleast five different pairs of integers and check this.

In the first case (\u20133) and (\u20132) are grouped together and in the second (\u20132) and 5 are grouped together. We see that [(\u20133) \u00d7 (\u20132)] \u00d7 5 = 6 \u00d7 5 = 30 and (\u20133) \u00d7 [(\u20132) \u00d7 5] = (\u20133) \u00d7 (\u201310) = 30 So, we get the same answer in both the cases.

No. In general, for any three integers a, b and c (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c) Take any five values for a, b and c each and verify this property.

For example, \u2013 2 \u00d7 7 = \u2013 14 and \u2013 3 \u00d7 \u2013 8 = 24. 3. Product of even number of negative integers is positive, whereas the product of odd number of negative integers is negative. 4. Integers show some properties under multiplication. (a) Integers are closed under multiplication. That is, a \u00d7 b is an integer for any two integers a and b. (b) Multiplication is commutative for integers. That is, a \u00d7 b = b \u00d7 a for any integers a and b. (c) The integer 1 is the identity under multiplication, i.e., 1 \u00d7 a = a \u00d7 1 = a for any integer a. (d) Multiplication is associative for integers, i.e., (a \u00d7 b) \u00d7 c = a \u00d7 (b \u00d7 c) for any three integers a, b and c. 5. Under addition and multiplication, integers show a property called distributive property. That is, a \u00d7 (b + c) = a \u00d7 b + a \u00d7 c for any three integers a, b and c. 6. The properties of commutativity, associativity under addition and multiplication, and the distributive property help us to make our calculations easier. 7. We also learnt how to divide integers. We found that, (a) When a positive integer is divided by a negative integer, the quotient obtained is negative and vice-versa. (b) Division of a negative integer by another negative integer gives positive as quotient. 8. For any integer a, we have (a) a \u00f7 0 is not defined (b) a \u00f7 1 = a 2024-25"

The numbers used for this purpose were called counting numbers or natural numbers. They are 1, 2, 3, 4, ... By including 0 to natural numbers, we got the whole numbers, i.e., 0, 1, 2, 3, ... The negatives of natural numbers were then put together with whole numbers to make up integers. Integers are ..., \u20133, \u20132, \u20131, 0, 1, 2, 3, .... We, thus, extended the number system, from natural numbers to whole numbers and from whole numbers to integers. You were also introduced to fractions. These are numbers of the form numerator denominator , where the numerator is either 0 or a positive integer and the denominator, a positive integer. You compared two fractions, found their equivalent forms and studied all the four basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division on them. In this Chapter, we shall extend the number system further. We shall introduce the concept of rational numbers alongwith their addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations. 8.2 NEED FOR RATIONAL NUMBERS Earlier, we have seen how integers could be used to denote opposite situations involving numbers. For example, if the distance of 3 km to the right of a place was denoted by 3, then the distance of 5 km to the left of the same place could be denoted by \u20135. If a profit of ` 150 was represented by 150 then a loss of ` 100 could be written as \u2013100. There are many situations similar to the above situations that involve fractional numbers. You can represent a distance of 750m above sea level as 3 4 km. Can we represent 750m below sea level in km? Can we denote the distance of 3 4 km below sea level by 3 4 \u2212? We can see 3 4 \u2212 is neither an integer, nor a fractional number. We need to extend our number system to include such numbers. Chapter 8 2024-25",
            "Page2": "RATIONAL NUMBERS 125 8.3 WHAT ARE RATIONAL NUMBERS? The word \u2018rational\u2019 arises from the term \u2018ratio\u2019. You know that a ratio like 3:2 can also be written as 3 2 . Here, 3 and 2 are natural numbers. Similarly, the ratio of two integers p and q (q \u2260 0), i.e., p:q can be written in the form p q . This is the form in which rational numbers are expressed. A rational number is defined as a number that can be expressed in the form p q , where p and q are integers and q \u2260 0. Thus, 4 5 is a rational number. Here, p = 4 and q = 5. Is 3 4 \u2212 also a rational number? Yes, because p = \u2013 3 and q = 4 are integers. l You have seen many fractions like 3 8 4 8 12 3 , , etc. All fractions are rational numbers. Can you say why? How about the decimal numbers like 0.5, 2.3, etc.? Each of such numbers can be written as an ordinary fraction and, hence, are rational numbers. For example, 0.5 = 5 10 , 0.333 = 333 1000 etc. 1. Is the number 2 3 \u2212 rational? Think about it. 2. List ten rational numbers. Numerator and Denominator In p q , the integer p is the numerator, and the integer q (\u2260 0) is the denominator. Thus, in 3 7 \u2212, the numerator is \u20133 and the denominator is 7. Mention five rational numbers each of whose (a) Numerator is a negative integer and denominator is a positive integer. (b) Numerator is a positive integer and denominator is a negative integer. (c) Numerator and denominator both are negative integers. (d) Numerator and denominator both are positive integers. l Are integers also rational numbers? Any integer can be thought of as a rational number. For example, the integer \u20135 is a rational number, because you can write it as 5 1 \u2212. The integer 0 can also be written as 0 0 2 0 7 = or etc. Hence, it is also a rational number. Thus, rational numbers include integers and fractions. TRY THESE 2024-25",
            "Page3": "MATHEMATICS 126 Equivalent rational numbers A rational number can be written with different numerators and denominators. For example, consider the rational number \u2013 2 3 . \u2013 2 3 = \u20132 2 \u2013 4 3 2 6 \u00d7 = \u00d7 . We see that \u2013 2 3 is the same as \u2013 4 6 .

Such rational numbers that are equal to each other are said to be equivalent to each other. Again, 10 15 \u2212 = \u221210 15 (How?) By multiplying the numerator and denominator of a rational number by the same non zero integer, we obtain another rational number equivalent to the given rational number. This is exactly like obtaining equivalent fractions. Just as multiplication, the division of the numerator and denominator by the same non zero integer, also gives equivalent rational numbers. For example, 10 \u201315 = ( ) ( ) 10 \u20135 \u20132 \u201315 \u20135 3 \u00f7 = \u00f7 , \u201312 24 = 12 12 1 24 12 2 \u2212 \u00f7 \u2212 = \u00f7 We write \u20132 3 as \u2013 2 3 , \u201310 15 as \u201310 15 , etc. 8.4 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE RATIONAL NUMBERS Consider the rational number 2 3 . Both the numerator and denominator of this number are positive integers. Such a rational number is called a positive rational number. So, 3 8 5 7 2 9 , , etc. are positive rational numbers. The numerator of \u20133 5 is a negative integer, whereas the denominator is a positive integer. Such a rational number is called a negative rational number.

Let us draw one such number line. The points to the right of 0 are denoted by + sign and are positive integers. The points to the left of 0 are denoted by \u2013 sign and are negative integers. Representation of fractions on a number line is also known to you. Let us see how the rational numbers can be represented on a number line. Let us represent the number \u22121 2 on the number line. As done in the case of positive integers, the positive rational numbers would be marked on the right of 0 and the negative rational numbers would be marked on the left of 0. To which side of 0 will you mark \u22121 2 ? Being a negative rational number, it would be marked to the left of 0. You know that while marking integers on the number line, successive integers are marked at equal intervels. Also, from 0, the pair 1 and \u20131 is equidistant. So are the pairs 2 and \u20132, 3 and \u20133. TRY THESE 1. Is \u2013 8 a negative rational number? 2. List five more negative rational numbers. TRY THESE 2024-25",

It is marked at a point which is half the distance between 0 and 1. So, \u22121 2 would be marked at a point half the distance between 0 and \u20131. We know how to mark 3 2 on the number line. It is marked on the right of 0 and lies halfway between 1 and 2. Let us now mark 3 2 \u2212 on the number line. It lies on the left of 0 and is at the same distance as 3 2 from 0. In decreasing order, we have, 1 2 , ( 1) 2 2 \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 , 3 4 , ( 2) 2 2 \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 . This shows that 3 2 \u2212 lies between \u2013 1 and \u2013 2. Thus, 3 2 \u2212 lies halfway between \u2013 1 and \u2013 2. Mark \u22125 2 and \u22127 2 in a similar way. Similarly, \u22121 3 is to the left of zero and at the same distance from zero as 1 3 is to the right. So as done above, \u22121 3 can be represented on the number line. Once we know how to represent \u22121 3 on the number line, we can go on representing 2 4 5 , , 3 3 3 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 and so on. All other rational numbers with different denominators can be represented in a similar way. 8.6 RATIONAL NUMBERS IN STANDARD FORM Observe the rational numbers 3 5 5 8 2 7 7 11 , , , \u2212 \u2212 . The denominators of these rational numbers are positive integers and 1 is the only common factor between the numerators and denominators. Further, the negative sign occurs only in the numerator.

If a rational number is not in the standard form, then it can be reduced to the standard form. Recall that for reducing fractions to their lowest forms, we divided the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the same non zero positive integer. We shall use the same method for reducing rational numbers to their standard form. EXAMPLE 1 Reduce 45 30 \u2212 to the standard form.

Thus, to reduce the rational number to its standard form, we divide its numerator and denominator by their HCF ignoring the negative sign, if any. (The reason for ignoring the negative sign will be studied in Higher Classes) If there is negative sign in the denominator, divide by \u2018\u2013 HCF\u2019.

Let us now see how we can compare two rational numbers. l Two positive rational numbers, like 2 3 5 7 and can be compared as studied earlier in the case of fractions. l Mary compared two negative rational numbers \u22121 2 and \u22121 5 using number line. She knew that the integer which was on the right side of the other integer, was the greater integer. For example, 5 is to the right of 2 on the number line and 5 > 2. The integer \u2013 2 is on the right of \u2013 5 on the number line and \u2013 2 > \u2013 5. She used this method for rational numbers also. She knew how to mark rational numbers on the number line. She marked \u22121 2 and \u22121 5 as follows: Has she correctly marked the two points? How and why did she convert \u22121 2 to \u22125 10 and \u22121 5 to \u22122 10 ? She found that \u22121 5 is to the right of \u22121 2 . Thus, \u22121 5 >\u22121 2 or \u22121 2 <\u22121 5 . Can you compare \u22123 4 and \u22122 3 ? \u22121 3 and \u22121 5 ?

To compare two negative rational numbers, we compare them ignoring their negative signs and then reverse the order. For example, to compare \u22127 5 and \u22125 3 , we first compare 7 5 and 5 3 . We get 7 5 < 5 3 and conclude that \u20137 \u20135 > 5 3 . Take five more such pairs and compare them. Which is greater \u22123 8 or \u22122 7 ?; \u22124 3 or \u22123 2 ? l Comparison of a negative and a positive rational number is obvious.

From her earlier classes, she knew there would be exactly 6 whole numbers between 3 and 10. Similarly, she wanted to know the total number of integers between \u20133 and 3. The integers between \u20133 and 3 are \u20132, \u20131, 0, 1, 2. Thus, there are exactly 5 integers between \u20133 and 3. Are there any integers between \u20133 and \u20132?

So adding \u22125 3 to 7 3 will mean, moving to the left of 7 3 , making 5 jumps. Where do we reach? We reach at 2 3 . So, 7 3 5 3 2 3 + \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7= . Let us now try this way: 7 3 5 3 7 5 3 2 3 + \u2212 ( ) = + \u2212 ( ) = We get the same answer. Find 6 5 2 5 3 7 5 7 + \u2212 ( ) + \u2212 ( ) , in both ways and check if you get the same answers. \u22123 3 \u22122 3 \u22121 3 0 3 1 3 2 3 3 3 4 3 5 3 6 3 7 3 8 3 2024-25",

Thus, \u2212 + = \u2212 + = \u2212 11 5 7 5 11 7 5 4 5 l How do we add rational numbers with different denominators? As in the case of fractions, we first find the LCM of the two denominators.

EXAMPLE 6Satpal walks 2 3 km from a place P, towards east and then from there 15 7 km towards west. Where will he be now from P? SOLUTION Let us denote the distance travelled towards east by positive sign. So, the distances towards west would be denoted by negative sign.

The numbers 2 3 , ,3 7 8 \u2212 etc. are rational numbers. 2. All integers and fractions are rational numbers. 3. If the numerator and denominator of a rational number are multiplied or divided by a non-zero integer, we get a rational number which is said to be equivalent to the given rational number. For example 3 3 2 6 7 7 2 14 \u2212 \u2212\u00d7 \u2212 = = \u00d7 . So, we say 6 14 \u2212 is the equivalent form of 3 7 \u2212. Also note that 6 6 2 3 14 14 2 7 \u2212 \u2212 \u00f7 \u2212 = = \u00f7 . 4. Rational numbers are classified as Positive and Negative rational numbers. When the numerator and denominator, both, are positive integers, it is a positive rational number. When either the numerator or the denominator is a negative integer, it is a negative rational number. For example, 3 8 is a positive rational number whereas 8 9 \u2212 is a negative rational number. 5. The number 0 is neither a positive nor a negative rational number. 6. A rational number is said to be in the standard form if its denominator is a positive integer and the numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1. The numbers 1 2 , 3 7 \u2212 etc. are in standard form. 7. There are unlimited number of rational numbers between two rational numbers. 8. Two rational numbers with the same denominator can be added by adding their numerators, keeping the denominator same. Two rational numbers with different denominators are added by first taking the LCM of the two denominators and then converting both the rational numbers to their equivalent forms having the LCM as the denominator. For example, 2 3 16 9 16 9 7 3 8 24 24 24 24 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 + = + = = . Here, LCM of 3 and 8 is 24. 9. While subtracting two rational numbers, we add the additive inverse of the rational number to be subtracted to the other rational number. Thus, 7 2 7 2 additive inverse of 8 3 8 3 \u2212 = + = 7 ( 2) 21 ( 16) 5 8 3 24 24 \u2212 + \u2212 + = = . 2024-25",

Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator 100 and have been used in comparing results. Let us try to understand in detail about it. 7.1.1 Meaning of Percentage Per cent is derived from Latin word \u2018per centum\u2019 meaning \u2018per hundred\u2019. Per cent is represented by the symbol % and means hundredths too. That is 1% means 1 out of hundred or one hundredth. It can be written as: 1% = 1 100 = 0.01 To understand this, let us consider the following example. 2024-25",

How do we calculate Percentage of an item if the total number of items do not add up to 100? In such cases, we need to convert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with denominator 100.

In the method shown in the table, we multiply the fraction by 100 100 . This does not change the value of the fraction. Subsequently, only 100 remains in the denominator. Anwar has used the unitary method. Asha has multiplied by 5 5 to get 100 in the denominator. You can use whichever method you find suitable. May be, you can make your own method too. The method used by Anwar can work for all ratios. Can the method used by Asha also work for all ratios? Anwar says Asha\u2019s method can be used only if you can find a natural number which on multiplication with the denominator gives 100. Since denominator was 20, she could multiply it by 5 to get 100. If the denominator was 6, she would not have been able to use this method. Do you agree? 1.

We have also learnt to convert fractional numbers and decimals to percentages. Now, we shall learn how percentages can be used in real life. For this, we start with interpreting the following statements: \u2014 5% of the income is saved by Ravi. \u2014 20% of Meera\u2019s dresses are blue in colour. \u2014 Rekha gets 10% on every book sold by her. What can you infer from each of these statements? By 5% we mean 5 parts out of 100 or we write it as 5 100 . It means Ravi is saving ` 5 out of every ` 100 that he earns. In the same way, interpret the rest of the statements given above. 7.2.2 Converting Percentages to \u201cHow Many\u201d Consider the following examples: EXAMPLE 6 A survey of 40 children showed that 25% liked playing football.

Consider the following example: EXAMPLE 8 Reena\u2019s mother said, to make idlis, you must take two parts rice and one part urad dal. What percentage of such a mixture would be rice and what percentage would be urad dal? SOLUTION In terms of ratio we would write this as Rice : Urad dal = 2 : 1. Now, 2 + 1=3 is the total of all parts. This means rd 2 3 part is rice and rd 1 3 part is urad dal. Then, percentage of rice would be 2 3 100 200 3 66 2 3 \u00d7 = = % %.

For example, if the population of a state increased from 5,50,000 to 6,05,000. Then the increase in population can be understood better if we say, the population increased by 10 %. How do we convert the increase or decrease in a quantity as a percentage of the initial amount? Consider the following example. EXAMPLE 10A school team won 6 games this year against 4 games won last year. What is the per cent increase? SOLUTION The increase in the number of wins (or amount of change) = 6 \u2013 4 = 2. Percentage increase = amount of change original amount or base \u00d7 100 = increase in the number of wins \u00d7100 original number of wins = 2 4 \u00d7 100 = 50 EXAMPLE 11The number of illiterate persons in a country decreased from 150 lakhs to 100 lakhs in 10 years.

My mother says, in her childhood petrol was ` 1 a litre. It is ` 52 per litre today. By what Percentage has the price gone up? 7.3 PRICES RELATED TO AN ITEM OR BUYING AND SELLING I bought it for ` 600 and will sell it for ` 610 The buying price of any item is known as its cost price. It is written in short as CP. The price at which you sell is known as the selling price or in short SP. What would you say is better, to you sell the item at a lower price, same price or higher price than your buying price? You can decide whether the sale was profitable or not depending on the CP and SP. If CP < SP then you made a profit = SP \u2013 CP. If CP = SP then you are in a no profit no loss situation. If CP > SP then you have a loss = CP \u2013 SP. Let us try to interpret the statements related to prices of items. l A toy bought for ` 72 is sold at ` 80. l A T-shirt bought for ` 120 is sold at ` 100. l A cycle bought for ` 800 is sold for ` 940. Let us consider the first statement. The buying price (or CP) is ` 72 and the selling price (or SP) is ` 80. This means SP is more than CP. Hence profit made = SP \u2013 CP = ` 80 \u2013 ` 72 = ` 8 Now try interpreting the remaining statements in a similar way. 7.3.1 Profit or Loss as a Percentage The profit or loss can be converted to a percentage. It is always calculated on the CP. For the above examples, we can find the profit % or loss %. Let us consider the example related to the toy. We have CP = ` 72, SP = ` 80, Profit = ` 8. To find the percentage of profit, Neha and Shekhar have used the following methods. TRY THESE 2024-25",
            "Page12": "COMPARING QUANTITIES 119 Thus, the profit is ` 8 and profit Per cent is 1 119 . Thus, by both methods we get the SP as ` 108. On ` 120, the loss is ` 20 So on ` 100, the loss Neha does it this way Shekhar does it this way Profit per cent = Profit CP \u00d7 100 = 8 72 \u00d7100 On ` 72 the profit is ` 8 = 1 9 100 \u00d7 = 111 9 On ` 100, profit = 8 72 \u00d7100 = 111 9 . Thus, profit per cent = 1 119 Similarly you can find the loss per cent in the second situation. Here, CP = ` 120, SP = ` 100. Therefore, Loss = ` 120 \u2013 ` 100 = ` 20 Loss per cent = Loss \u00d7100 CP = 20 \u00d7100 120 = \u00d7 = = 20 120 100 50 3 16 2 3 = 50 2 16 3 3 = Thus, loss per cent is 2 16 3 Try the last case. Now we see that given any two out of the three quantities related to prices that is, CP, SP, amount of Profit or Loss or their percentage, we can find the rest. EXAMPLE 12 The cost of a flower vase is ` 120. If the shopkeeper sells it at a loss of 10%, find the price at which it is sold. SOLUTION We are given that CP = ` 120 and Loss per cent = 10. We have to find the SP. Sohan does it like this Anandi does it like this Loss of 10% means if CP is ` 100, Loss is 10% of the cost price Loss is ` 10 = 10% of ` 120 Therefore, SP would be = 10 120 100 \u00d7 = ` 12 ` (100 \u2013 10) = ` 90 Therefore When CP is ` 100, SP is ` 90. SP = CP \u2013 Loss Therefore, if CP were ` 120 then = ` 120 \u2013 ` 12 = ` 108 SP = 90 120 100 \u00d7 = ` 108 2024-25",

Amina does it like this Arun does it like this 20% profit will mean if CP is ` 100, Profit = 20% of CP and SP = CP + Profit profit is ` 20 So, 540 = CP + 20% of CP = CP + 20 100 \u00d7 CP = 1 1 CP 5 \uf8ee \uf8f9 + \uf8ef \uf8fa \uf8f0 \uf8fb = 6 CP 5 .

Mohan asked her whether they had the money to buy it. Sohini said her father was going to take a loan from a bank. The money you borrow is known as sum borrowed or principal. This money would be used by the borrower for some time before it is returned. For keeping this money for some time the borrower has to pay some extra money to the bank. This is known as Interest. You can find the amount you have to pay at the end of the year by adding the sum borrowed and the interest. That is, Amount = Principal + Interest. Interest is generally given in per cent for a period of one year. It is written as say 10% per year or per annum or in short as 10% p.a. (per annum). 10% p.a. means on every ` 100 borrowed, ` 10 is the interest you have to pay for one year. Let us take an example and see how this works. EXAMPLE 14 Anita takes a loan of ` 5,000 at 15% per year as rate of interest. Find the interest she has to pay at the end of one year. Therefore, SP = 100 + 20 = 120 Now, when SP is ` 120, then CP is ` 100. Therefore, when SP is ` 540, then CP = 100 540 120 \u00d7 = ` 450 TRY THESE 2024-25",
            "Page14": "COMPARING QUANTITIES 121 SOLUTION The sum borrowed = ` 5,000, Rate of interest = 15% per year. This means if ` 100 is borrowed, she has to pay ` 15 as interest for one year. If she has borrowed ` 5,000, then the interest she has to pay for one year = ` 15 5000 100 \u00d7 = ` 750 So, at the end of the year she has to give an amount of ` 5,000 + ` 750 = ` 5,750. We can write a general relation to find interest for one year. Take P as the principal or sum and R % as Rate per cent per annum. Now on every ` 100 borrowed, the interest paid is ` R Therefore, on ` P borrowed, the interest paid for one year would be 100 R P \u00d7 = P R \u00d7 100 . 7.4.1 Interest for Multiple Years If the amount is borrowed for more than one year the interest is calculated for the period the money is kept for. For example, if Anita returns the money at the end of two years and the rate of interest is the same then she would have to pay twice the interest i.e., ` 750 for the first year and ` 750 for the second. This way of calculating interest where principal is not changed is known as simple interest. As the number of years increase the interest also increases. For ` 100 borrowed for 3 years at 18%, the interest to be paid at the end of 3 years is 18 + 18 + 18 = 3 \u00d7 18 = ` 54. We can find the general form for simple interest for more than one year. We know that on a principal of ` P at R% rate of interest per year, the interest paid for one year is R P \u00d7 100 . Therefore, interest I paid for T years would be T R P P R T PRT \u00d7 \u00d7 = \u00d7 \u00d7 100 100 100 or And amount you have to pay at the end of T years is A = P + I 1. ` 10,000 is invested at 5% interest rate p.a.

A way of comparing quantities is percentage. Percentages are numerators of fractions with denominator 100. Per cent means per hundred. For example 82% marks means 82 marks out of hundred. 2. Fractions can be converted to percentages and vice-versa. For example, 1 4 1 4 100 = \u00d7 % whereas, 75% = 75 100 3 4 = 3. Decimals too can be converted to percentages and vice-versa. For example, 0.25 = 0.25 \u00d7 100% = = 25% 4. Percentages are widely used in our daily life, (a) We have learnt to find exact number when a certain per cent of the total quantity is given.

            "Page3": "iii Foreword The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children\u2019s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children\u2019s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in science and mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Dr H.K. Dewan for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee, appointed by the Department of Secondary and Higher Education, Ministry of Human Resource Development under the Chairpersonship of Professor Mrinal Miri and Professor G.P. Deshpande, for their valuable time anc contribution. As an organisation committed to systemic reform and continuous improvement in the quality of its products, NCERT welcomes comments and suggestions which will enable us to undertake further revision and refinement.

The National Education Policy 2020, also emphasises reducing the content load and providing opportunities for experiential learning with creative mindset. In this background, the NCERT has undertaken the exercise to rationalise the textbooks across all classes. Learning Outcomes already developed by the NCERT across classes have been taken into consideration in this exercise. Contents of the textbooks have been rationalised in view of the following: \u2022 Overlapping with similar content included in other subject areas in the same class \u2022 Similar content included in the lower or higher class in the same subject \u2022 Difficulty level \u2022 Content, which is easily accessible to students without much interventions from teachersand can be learned by children through self-learning or peer- learning \u2022 Content, which is irrelevant in the present context This present edition, is a reformatted version after carrying out the changes given above. 2024-25",

            "Page7": "vii Preface The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005 suggests the need for developing the ability for mathematisation in the child. It points out that the aim of learning mathematics is not merely being able to do quantitative calculations but also to develop abilities in the child that would enable her/him to redefine her/his relationship with the World. The NCF-2005 also lays emphasis on development in the children logical abilities as well as abilities to comprehend space, spatial transformations and develop the ability to visualise both these. It recommends that mathematics needs to slowly move towards abstraction even though it starts from concrete experiences and models. The ability to generalise and perceive patterns is an important step in being able to relate to the abstract and logic governed nature of the subject. We also know that most children in upper primary and secondary classes develop a fear of mathematics and it is one of the reasons for students not being able to continue in schools. NCF-2005 has also mentioned this problem and has therefore emphasised the need to develop a programme which is relevant and meaningful. The need for conceptualising mathematics teaching allows children to explore concepts as well as develop their own ways of solving problems. This also forms corner-stone of the principles highlighted in the NCF-2005. In Class VI we have begun the process of developing a programme which would help children understand the abstract nature of mathematics while developing in them the ability to construct their own concepts. As suggested by NCF-2005, an attempt has been made to allow multiple ways of solving problems and encouraging children to develop strategies different from each other. There is an emphasis on working with basic principles rather than on memorisation of algorithms and short-cuts. The Class VII textbook has continued that spirit and has attempted to use language which the children can read and understand themselves. This reading can be in groups or individual and at some places require help and support by the teacher. We also tried to include a variety of examples and opportunities for children to set problems. The appearance of the book has sought to be made pleasant by including many illustrations. The book attempts to engage the mind of the child actively and provides opportunities to use concepts and develop her/his own structures rather than struggling with unnecessarily complicated terms and numbers. We hope that this book would help all children in their attempt to learn mathematics and would build in them the ability to appreciate its power and beauty. We also hope that this would enable to revisit and consolidate concepts and skills that they have learnt in the primary school. We hope to strengthen the foundation of mathematics, on which further engagement with studies as well as her daily life would become possible in an enriched manner. The team in developing the textbook consists of many teachers who are experienced and brought to the team the view point of the child and the school. We also had people who have done research in learning of mathematics and those who have been writing textbooks for mathematics for many years. The team has tried to make an effort to remove fear of mathematics from the minds of children and make it a part of their daily routine even outside the school. We had many discussions and a review process with some other teachers of schools across the country. The effort by the team has been to accommodate all the comments. In the end, I would like to place on record our gratefulness to Prof Krishna Kumar, Director, NCERT, Prof G. Ravindra, Joint Director, NCERT and Prof Hukum Singh, Head, DESM, for giving opportunity to me and the team to work on this challenging task. I am also grateful to 2024-25",

I am also grateful for the support of all those who were part of this team including Prof S.K. Singh Gautam, Dr V.P. Singh and Dr Ashutosh K. Wazalwar from NCERT, who have worked very hard to make this possible. In the end I must thank the Publication Department of NCERT for its support and advice and those from Vidya Bhawan who helped produce the book. The process of developing materials is a continuous one and we would hope to make this book better. Suggestions and comments on the book are most welcome. Dr H.K.

            "Page9": "ix A Note for the Teachers This book is a continuation of the process and builds on what was initiated in Class VI. We had shared with you the main points reflected in NCF-2005. These include relating mathematics to a wider development of abilities in children, moving away from complex calculations and algorithms following, to understanding and constructing a framework of understanding. The mathematical ideas in the mind of the child grow neither by telling nor by merely giving explanations. For children to learn mathematics, to be confident in it and understand the foundational ideas, they need to develop their own framework of concepts. This would require a classroom where children discuss ideas, look for solutions of problems, set new problems and find not only their own ways of solving problems but also their own definitions with the language they can use and understand. These definitions need not be as general and complete as the standard ones. In the mathematics class it is important to help children read with understanding the textbook and other references. The reading of materials is not normally considered to be related to learning of mathematics but learning mathematics any further would require the child to comprehend the text. The text in mathematics uses a language that has brevity. It requires the ability to deal with terseness and with symbols, to follow logical arguments and appreciate the need for keeping certain factors and constraints. Children need practice in translating mathematical statements into normal statements expressing ideas in words and vice-a-versa. We would require children to become confident of using language in words and also being able to communicate through mathematical statements. Mathematics at the upper primary stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. Children often are not able to work in terms of ideas alone. They need the comfort of context and/or models linked to their experience to find meaning. This stage presents before us the challenge of engaging the children while using the contexts but gradually moving them away from such dependence. So while children should be able to identify the principles to be used in a contextual situation, they should not be dependent or be limited to contexts. As we progress further in the middle school there would be greater requirement from the child to be able to do this. Learning mathematics is not about remembering solutions or methods but knowing how to solve problems. Problem-solving strategies give learners opportunities to think rationally, enabling them to understand and create methods as well as processes; they become active participants in the construction of new knowledge rather than being passive receivers. Learners need to identify and define a problem, select or design possible solutions and revise or redesign the steps, if required. The role of a teacher gets modified to that of a guide and facilitator. Students need to be provided with activities and challenging problems, along with sets of many problem-solving experiences. On being presented a problem, children first need to decode it. They need to identify the knowledge required for attempting it and build a model for it. This model could be in the form of an illustration or a situation construct. We must remember that for generating proofs in geometry the figures constructed are also models of the ideal dimensionless figure. These diagrams are, however, more abstract than the concrete models required for attempting problems in arithmetic and algebra. Helping children to develop the ability to construct appropriate models by breaking up the problems and evolving their own strategies and analysis of problems is extremely important. This should replace prescriptive algorithms to solve problems. Teachers are expected to encourage cooperative learning. Children learn a lot in purposeful conversation with each other. Our classrooms should develop in the students the desire and capacity to learn from each other rather than compete. Conversation is not noise and consultation is not cheating. It is a challenge to make possible classroom groups that benefit the most from being with each other 2024-25",
            "Page10": "and in which each child contributes to the learning of the group. Teachers must recognise that different children and different groups will use distinct strategies. Some of these strategies would appear to be more efficient and some not as efficient. They would reflect the modelling done by each group and would indicate the process of thinking used. It is inappropriate to identify the best strategy or pull down incorrect strategies. We need to record all strategies adopted and analyse them. During this, it is crucial to discuss why some of the strategies are unsuccessful. The class as a group can improve upon the ineffective and unsuccessful strategies and correct them. This implies that we need to complete each strategy rather than discard some as incorrect or inappropriate. Exposures to a variety of strategies would deepen mathematical understanding and ability to learn from others. This would also help them to understand the importance of being aware of what one is doing. Enquiry to understand is one of the natural ways by which students acquire and construct knowledge. The process can even begin with casual observations and end in generation and acquisition of knowledge. This can be aided by providing examples for different forms of questioning-explorative, open-ended, contextual, error detection etc. Students need to get exposed to challenging investigations. For example in geometry there could be things like, experimenting with suitable nets for solids, visualising solids through shadow play, slicing and elevations etc. In arithmetic we can make them explore relationships among members, generalise the relationships, discover patterns and rules and then form algebraic relations etc. Children need the opportunity to follow logical arguments and find loopholes in the arguments presented. This will lead them to understand the requirement of a proof. At this stage topics like Geometry are poised to enter a formal stage. Provide activities that encourage students to exercise creativity and imagination while discovering geometric vocabulary and relationships using simple geometric tools. Mathematics has to emerge as a subject of exploration and creation rather than an exercise of finding answers to old and complicated problems. There is a need to encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems. They also need to appreciate the use of many alternative algorithms and strategies that may be adopted to solve a problem. Topics like Integers, Fractions and Decimals, Symmetry have been presented here by linking them with their introductory parts studied in earlier classes. An attempt has been made to link chapters with each other and the ideas introduced in the initial chapters have been used to evolve concepts in the subsequent chapters. Please devote enough time to the ideas of negative integers, rational numbers, exploring statements in Geometry and visualising solids shapes. We hope that the book will help children learn to enjoy mathematics and be confident in the concepts introduced. We want to recommend the creation of opportunity for thinking individually and collectively. Group discussions need to become a regular feature of mathematics classroom thereby making learners confident about mathematics and make the fear of mathematics a thing of past. We look forward to your comments and suggestions regarding the book and hope that you will send interesting exercises, activities and tasks that you develop during the course of teaching, to be included in the future editions. x 2024-25",

            "Page1": "MATHEMATICS 186 12.1 INTRODUCTION Symmetry is an important geometrical concept, commonly exhibited in nature and is used almost in every field of activity. Artists, professionals, designers of clothing or jewellery, car manufacturers, architects and many others make use of the idea of symmetry. The beehives, the flowers, the tree-leaves, religious symbols, rugs, and handkerchiefs \u2014 everywhere you find symmetrical designs. You have already had a \u2018feel\u2019 of line symmetry in your previous class. A figure has a line symmetry, if there is a line about which the figure may be folded so that the two parts of the figure will coincide. You might like to recall these ideas. Here are some activities to help you. Nature Architecture Engineering Create some colourful Ink-dot devils Make some symmetrical paper-cut designs. Compose a picture-album showing symmetry. Chapter 12 Symmetry 2024-25",
            "Page2": "SYMMETRY 187 Enjoy identifying lines (also called axes) of symmetry in the designs you collect. Let us now strengthen our ideas on symmetry further. Study the following figures in which the lines of symmetry are marked with dotted lines. [Fig 12.1 (i) to (iv)] 12.2 LINES OF SYMMETRY FOR REGULAR POLYGONS You know that a polygon is a closed figure made of several line segments. The polygon made up of the least number of line segments is the triangle. (Can there be a polygon that you can draw with still fewer line segments? Think about it). A polygon is said to be regular if all its sides are of equal length and all its angles are of equal measure. Thus, an equilateral triangle is a regular polygon of three sides. Can you name the regular polygon of four sides? An equilateral triangle is regular because each of its sides has same length and each of its angles measures 60\u00b0 (Fig 12.2). A square is also regular because all its sides are of equal length and each of its angles is a right angle (i.e., 90\u00b0). Its diagonals are seen to be perpendicular bisectors of one another (Fig 12.3). Fig 12.1 (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) 60\u00b0 60\u00b0 60\u00b0 a a a Fig 12.2 Fig 12.3 2024-25",
            "Page3": "MATHEMATICS 188 If a pentagon is regular, naturally, its sides should have equal length. You will, later on, learn that the measure of each of its angles is 108\u00b0 (Fig 12.4). A regular hexagon has all its sides equal and each of its angles measures 120\u00b0. You will learn more of these figures later (Fig 12.5). The regular polygons are symmetrical figures and hence their lines of symmetry are quite interesting, Each regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides [Fig 12.6 (i) - (iv)]. We say, they have multiple lines of symmetry. Perhaps, you might like to investigate this by paper folding. Go ahead! The concept of line symmetry is closely related to mirror reflection. A shape has line symmetry when one half of it is the mirror image of the other half (Fig 12.7). A mirror line, thus, helps to visualise a line of symmetry (Fig 12.8). Is the dotted line a mirror line? No. Is the dotted line a mirror line? Yes. Fig 12.8 Fig 12.4 Fig 12.6 Fig 12.7 Fig 12.5 2024-25",

What other name can you give to the line of symmetry of (a) an isosceles triangle? (b) a circle? 12.3 ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY What do you say when the hands of a clock go round? You say that they rotate. The hands of a clock rotate in only one direction, about a fixed point, the centre of the clock-face. Rotation, like movement of the hands of a clock, is called a clockwise rotation; otherwise it is said to be anticlockwise. (a) (b) (c) 2024-25",
            "Page7": "MATHEMATICS 192 What can you say about the rotation of the blades of a ceiling fan? Do they rotate clockwise or anticlockwise? Or do they rotate both ways? If you spin the wheel of a bicycle, it rotates. It can rotate in either way: both clockwise and anticlockwise. Give three examples each for (i) a clockwise rotation and (ii) anticlockwise rotation. When an object rotates, its shape and size do not change. The rotation turns an object about a fixed point. This fixed point is the centre of rotation. What is the centre of rotation of the hands of a clock? Think about it. The angle of turning during rotation is called the angle of rotation. A full turn, you know, means a rotation of 360\u00b0. What is the degree measure of the angle of rotation for (i) a half-turn? (ii) a quarter-turn? A half-turn means rotation by 180\u00b0; a quarter-turn is rotation by 90\u00b0. When it is 12 O\u2019clock, the hands of a clock are together. By 3 O\u2019clock, the minute hand would have made three complete turns; but the hour hand would have made only a quarter-turn. What can you say about their positions at 6 O\u2019clock? Have you ever made a paper windmill? The Paper windmill in the picture looks symmetrical (Fig 12.11); but you do not find any line of symmetry. No folding can help you to have coincident halves. However if you rotate it by 90\u00b0 about the fixed point, the windmill will look exactly the same. We say the windmill has a rotational symmetry. Fig 12.12 In a full turn, there are precisely four positions (on rotation through the angles 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 270\u00b0 and 360\u00b0) when the windmill looks exactly the same. Because of this, we say it has a rotational symmetry of order 4. Here is one more example for rotational symmetry. Consider a square with P as one of its corners (Fig 12.13). Let us perform quarter-turns about the centre of the square marked .

Rotate again through 90\u00b0 and you get Fig 12.13 (iii). In this way, when you complete four quarter-turns, the square reaches its original position. It now looks the same as Fig12.13 (i). This can be seen with the help of the positions taken by P. Thus a square has a rotational symmetry of order 4 about its centre. Observe that in this case, (i) The centre of rotation is the centre of the square. (ii) The angle of rotation is 90\u00b0. (iii) The direction of rotation is clockwise.

What is the order of rotational symmetry? The point where we have the pin is the centre of rotation. It is the intersecting point of the diagonals in this case. Every object has a rotational symmetry of order 1, as it occupies same position after a rotation of 360\u00b0 (i.e., one complete revolution). Such cases have no interest for us. You have around you many shapes, which possess rotational symmetry (Fig 12.17). Fruit Road sign Wheel (i) (ii) (iii) Fig 12.17 For example, when you slice certain fruits, the cross-sections are shapes with rotational symmetry. This might surprise you when you notice them [Fig 12.17(i)]. Then there are many road signs that exhibit rotational symmetry. Next time when you walk along a busy road, try to identify such road signs and find about the order of rotational symmetry [Fig 12.17(ii)]. Think of some more examples for rotational symmetry.

By now you would have understood that some shapes have only line symmetry, some have only rotational symmetry and some have both line symmetry and rotational symmetry. For example, consider the square shape (Fig 12.19). How many lines of symmetry does it have? Does it have any rotational symmetry? If \u2018yes\u2019, what is the order of the rotational symmetry? Think about it. The circle is the most perfect symmetrical figure, because it can be rotated around its centre through any angle and at the same time it has unlimited number of lines of symmetry. Observe any circle pattern. Every line through the centre (that is every diameter) forms a line of (reflectional) symmetry and it has rotational symmetry around the centre for every angle.

They have multiple (i.e., more than one) lines of symmetry. 3. Each regular polygon has as many lines of symmetry as it has sides. Regular Regular Regular Square Equilateral Polygon hexagon pentagon triangle Number of lines 6 5 4 3 of symmetry 4. Mirror reflection leads to symmetry, under which the left-right orientation have to be taken care of. 5. Rotation turns an object about a fixed point. This fixed point is the centre of rotation. The angle by which the object rotates is the angle of rotation. A half-turn means rotation by 180o; a quarter-turn means rotation by 90o. Rotation may be clockwise or anticlockwise. 6. If, after a rotation, an object looks exactly the same, we say that it has a rotational symmetry. 7. In a complete turn (of 360o), the number of times an object looks exactly the same is called the order of rotational symmetry. The order of symmetry of a square, for example, is 4 while, for an equilateral triangle, it is 3. 8. Some shapes have only one line of symmetry, like the letter E; some have only rotational symmetry, like the letter S; and some have both symmetries like the letter H. The study of symmetry is important because of its frequent use in day-to-day life and more because of the beautiful designs it can provide us. 2024-25"

In our day to day life, we see several objects like books, balls, ice-cream cones etc., around us which have different shapes. One thing common about most of these objects is that they all have some length, breadth and height or depth. That is, they all occupy space and have three dimensions. Hence, they are called three dimensional shapes. Do you remember some of the three dimensional shapes (i.e., solid shapes) we have seen in earlier classes?

Here you see them for a cube: (i) (ii) (iii) Fig 13.3 The 8 corners of the cube are its vertices. The 12 line segments that form the skeleton of the cube are its edges.

We will now try to see how some of these 3-D shapes can be visualised on a 2-D surface, that is, on paper. In order to do this, we would like to get familiar with three dimensional objects closely. Let us try forming these objects by making what are called nets. 13.3 NETS FOR BUILDING 3-D SHAPES Take a cardboard box. Cut the edges to lay the box flat. You have now a net for that box.

When you draw a solid shape, the images are somewhat distorted to make them appear three-dimensional. It is a visual illusion. You will find here two techniques to help you. 13.4.1 Oblique Sketches Here is a picture of a cube (Fig 13.11). It gives a clear idea of how the cube looks like, when seen from the front.

How can you draw such sketches? Let us attempt to learn the technique. You need a squared (lines or dots) paper. Initially practising to draw on these sheets will later make it easy to sketch them on a plain sheet (without the aid of squared lines or dots!) Let us attempt to draw an oblique sketch of a 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 (each edge is 3 units) cube (Fig 13.12). Step 1 Step 2 Draw the front face. Draw the opposite face. Sizes of the faces have to be same, but the sketch is somewhat off-set from step 1. Step 3 Step 4 Join the corresponding corners Redraw using dotted lines for hidden edges. (It is a convention) The sketch is ready now. Fig 13.12 In the oblique sketch above, did you note the following? (i) The sizes of the front faces and its opposite are same; and (ii) The edges, which are all equal in a cube, appear so in the sketch, though the actual measures of edges are not taken so. You could now try to make an oblique sketch of a cuboid (remember the faces in this case are rectangles) Note: You can draw sketches in which measurements also agree with those of a given solid.

You could try to make on it some cubes or cuboids of dimensions specified by your friend. 13.4.3 Visualising Solid Objects Sometimes when you look at combined shapes, some of them may be hidden from your view. Here are some activities you could try in your free time to help you visualise some solid objects and how they look. Take some cubes and arrange them as shown in Fig 13.16.

You will be able to guess what the length, breadth and height of the cuboid would be.

It is like a cuboid with a square face. You \u2018slice\u2019 it with a knife. When you give a \u2018vertical\u2019 cut, you get several pieces, as shown in the Figure 13.20. Each face of the piece is a square! We call this face a \u2018cross-section\u2019 of the whole bread. The cross section is nearly a square in this case. Beware! If your cut is not \u2018vertical\u2019 you may get a different cross section! Think about it. The boundary of the cross-section you obtain is a plane curve. Do you notice it? A kitchen play Have you noticed cross-sections of some vegetables when they are cut for the purposes of cooking in the kitchen? Observe the various slices and get aware of the shapes that result as cross-sections. Fig 13.18 TRY THESE Fig 13.19 Fig 13.20 2024-25",

Have you seen a shadow play? It is a form of entertainment using solid articulated figures in front of an illuminated back-drop to create the illusion of moving images. It makes some indirect use of ideas in Mathematics. You will need a source of light and a few solid shapes for this activity. (If you have an overhead projector, place the solid under the lamp and do these investigations.) Keep a torchlight, right in front of a Cone. What type of shadow does it cast on the screen? (Fig 13.23) The solid is three-dimensional; what is the dimension of the shadow? If, instead of a cone, you place a cube in the above game, what type of shadow will you get? Experiment with different positions of the source of light and with different positions of the solid object. Study their effects on the shapes and sizes of the shadows you get. Here is another funny experiment that you might have tried already: Place a circular plate in the open when the Sun at the noon time is just right above it as shown in Fig 13.24 (i).

The circle, the square, the rectangle, the quadrilateral and the triangle are examples of plane figures; the cube, the cuboid, the sphere, the cylinder, the cone and the pyramid are examples of solid shapes. 2. Plane figures are of two-dimensions (2-D) and the solid shapes are of three-dimensions (3-D). 3. The corners of a solid shape are called its vertices; the line segments of its skeleton are its edges; and its flat surfaces are its faces. 4. A net is a skeleton-outline of a solid that can be folded to make it. The same solid can have several types of nets. 5. Solid shapes can be drawn on a flat surface (like paper) realistically. We call this 2-D representation of a 3-D solid. 6. Two types of sketches of a solid are possible: (a) An oblique sketch does not have proportional lengths. Still it conveys all important aspects of the appearance of the solid. (b) An isometric sketch is drawn on an isometric dot paper, a sample of which is given at the end of this book. In an isometric sketch of the solid the measurements kept proportional. 7. Visualising solid shapes is a very useful skill. You should be able to see \u2018hidden\u2019 parts of the solid shape. 8. Different sections of a solid can be viewed in many ways: (a) One way is to view by cutting or slicing the shape, which would result in the cross-section of the solid. (b) Another way is by observing a 2-D shadow of a 3-D shape. (c) A third way is to look at the shape from different angles; the front-view, the side-view and the top-view can provide a lot of information about the shape observed. 2024-25"

            "Page1": "Nutrition in Plants 1 I n Class VI you learnt that food is essential for all living organisms. You also learnt that carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals are components of food. These components of food are called nutrients and are necessary for our body. All living organisms require food. Plants can synthesise food for themselves but animals including humans cannot. They get it from plants or animals that eat plants. Thus, humans and animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants. 1.1 MODE OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS Plants are the only organisms that can prepare food for themselves by using water, carbon dioxide and minerals. The raw materials are present in their surroundings. The nutrients enable living organisms to build their bodies, to grow, to repair damaged parts of their bodies and provide the energy to carry out life processes. Nutrition is the mode of taking food by an organism and its utilisation by the body. The mode of nutrition in which organisms make food themselves from simple substances is called autotrophic (auto = self; trophos = nourishment) nutrition. Therefore, plants are called autotrophs. Animals and most other organisms take in food prepared by plants. They are called heterotrophs (heteros = other). Boojho wants to know how plants prepare their own food. Now we may ask where the food factories of plants are located: whether food is made in all parts of a plant or only in certain parts? How do plants obtain the raw materials from the surroundings? How do they transport them to the food factories of plants? 1.2 PHOTOSYNTHESIS \u2014 FOOD MAKING PROCESS IN PLANTS Leaves are the food factories of plants. Therefore, all the raw materials must reach the leaf. Water and minerals present in the soil are absorbed by the roots and transported to the leaves. Carbon dioxide from air is taken in Paheli wants to know why our body cannot make food from carbon dioxide, water and minerals like plants do.",
            "Page2": "SCIENCE 2 Paheli wants to know what is so special about the leaves that they can synthesise food but other parts of the plant cannot. Cells through the tiny pores present on the surface of leaves. These pores are surrounded by \u2018guard cells\u2019. Such pores are called stomata [Fig. 1.2 (c)]. Water and minerals are transported to the leaves by the vessels which run like pipes throughout the root, the stem, the branches and the leaves. They form a continuous path or passage for the nutrients to reach the leaf. They are called vessels. You will learn more about transport of materials in plants in Chapter 7. The leaves have a green pigment called chlorophyll. It helps leaves to capture the energy of the sunlight. This energy is used to synthesise (prepare) food from carbon dioxide and water. Since the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight, it is called photosynthesis (Photo: light; synthesis : to combine). So we find that chlorophyll, sunlight, carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis. It is a unique process on the earth. The solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plant in the form of food. Thus, sun is the ultimate source of energy for all living organisms. Can you imagine life on earth in the absence of photosynthesis! In the absence of photosynthesis there would not be any food. The survival of almost all living organisms directly or indirectly depends upon the food made by the plants. Besides, oxygen which is essential for the survival You have seen that buildings are made of bricks. Similarly, the bodies of living organisms are made of tiny units called cells. Cells can be seen only under the microscope. Some organisms are made of only one cell. The cell is enclosed by a thin outer boundary, called the cell membrane. Most cells have a distinct, centrally located spherical structure called the nucleus (Fig. 1.1). The nucleus is surrounded by a jelly-like substance called cytoplasm. Cell membrane Cytoplasm Nucleus Fig. 1.1 Cell Boojho wants to know how water and minerals absorbed by roots reach the leaves.",

The desert plants have scale- or spine-like leaves to reduce loss of water by transpiration. These plants have green stems which carry out photosynthesis. of all organisms is produced during photosynthesis. In the absence of photosynthesis, life would be impossible on the earth. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll containing cells of leaves (Fig. 1.2), in the presence of sunlight, use carbon dioxide and water to synthesise carbohydrates (Fig. 1.3). The process can be represented in an equation: During the process oxygen is released. The presence of starch in leaves indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis. Starch is also a carbohydrate. \uf02b \uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be\uf0be \uf0ae \uf02b sunlight chlorophyll Carbon dioxide water Carbohydrate oxygen Boojho has observed some plants with deep red, violet or brown leaves.

            "Page4": "SCIENCE 4 Fig. 1.4 Leaves of various colours carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. These are used to synthesise other components of food such as proteins and fats. But proteins are nitrogenous substances which contain nitrogen. From where do the plants obtain nitrogen? Recall that nitrogen is present in abundance in gaseous form in the air. However, plants cannot absorb nitrogen in this form. Soil has certain bacteria that convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable form and release it into the soil. These are absorbed by the plants along with water. Also, you might have seen farmers adding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the soil. In this way the plants fulfil their requirements of nitrogen along with the other constituents. Plants can then synthesise proteins and vitamins. 1.3 OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS There are some plants which do not have chlorophyll. They cannot synthesise food. How do they survive and from where do they derive nutrition? Like humans and animals such plants depend on the food produced by other plants. They use the heterotrophic mode of nutrition. Look at Fig. 1.5. Do you see a yellow wiry branched structure twining around the stem and branches of a tree? This is a plant called Cuscuta (Amarbel). It does not have chlorophyll. It takes readymade food from the plant on which it is climbing. The plant on which it climbs is called the host. Since it deprives the host of valuable nutrients, You often see slimy, green patches in ponds or stagnant water bodies. These are generally formed by the growth of organisms called algae. Can you guess why algae are green in colour? They contain chlorophyll which gives them the green colour. Algae can also prepare their own food by photosynthesis. Synthesis of plant food other than carbohydrates You have just learnt that plants synthesise carbohydrates through the process of photosynthesis. The Perform iodine test with the leaves of both the plants as you did in Class VI. Record your results. Now leave the pot which was earlier kept in the dark, in the sunlight for 3 \u2013 4 days and perform the iodine test again on its leaves. Record your observations in your notebook. The leaves other than green also have chlorophyll. The large amount of red, brown and other pigments mask the green colour (Fig. 1.4). Photosynthesis takes place in these leaves also.",

You should think about it and discuss with your teacher. hair which are directed downwards. When an insect lands in the pitcher, the lid closes and the trapped insect gets entangled into the hair. The lid closes and the insect is trapped. The insect is digested by the digestive juices secreted in the pitcher and its nutrients are absorbed. Such insect-eating plants are called insectivorous plants. Is it possible that such plants do not get all the required nutrients from the soil in which they grow? Fig. 1.5 Cuscuta (Amarbel) on host plant Paheli wants to know whether mosquitoes, bed bugs, lice and leeches that suck our blood are also parasites. Fig. 1.6 Pitcher plant showing lid and pitcher Leaf modified into pitcher Lid Boojho is confused. If the pitcher plant is green and carries out photosynthesis, then why does it feed on insects? Have you seen or heard of plants that can eat animals? There are a few plants which can trap insects and digest them. Is it not amazing? Such plants may be green or of some other colour. Look at the plant in Fig. 1.6. The pitcher-like or jug-like structure is the modified part of leaf. The apex of the leaf forms a lid which can open and close the mouth of the pitcher.

Let us find out what type of nutrients they need to survive and from where they get them. Boojho wants to know how these organisms acquire nutrients. They do not have mouths like animals do. They are not like green plants as they lack chlorophyll and cannot make food by photosynthesis. Activity 1.2 Take a piece of bread and moisten it with water. Leave it in a moist warm place for 2\u20133 days or until fluffy patches appear on them (Fig. 1.8). What is the colour of these patches? Observe the patches under a microscope or a magnifying glass. Write down your observations in the notebook. You will see cotton-like threads spread on the piece of bread. Paheli is keen to know whether her beautiful shoes, which she wore on special occasions, were spoiled by fungi during the rainy season. She wants to know how fungi appear suddenly during the rainy season. These organisms are called fungi. They have a different mode of nutrition. They absorb the nutrients from the bread. This mode of nutrition in which organisms take in nutrients from dead and decaying matter is called saprotrophic nutrition. Such organisms with saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs. Fungi also grow on pickles, leather, clothes and other articles that are left in hot and humid weather for long time. During the rainy season they spoil many things. Ask your parents about the menace of fungi in your house. The fungal spores are generally present in the air. When they land on Fig. 1.8 Fungi growing on bread Fig. 1.7 Packet of mushrooms, a mushroom growing on decayed material",
            "Page7": "NUTRITION IN PLANTS 7 1.5 HOW NUTRIENTS ARE REPLENISHED IN THE SOIL Have you seen farmers spreading manure or fertilisers in the fields, or gardeners using them in lawns or in pots? Do you know why this is done? You learnt that plants absorb minerals and nutrients from the soil. So, their amounts in the soil keep on declining. Fertilisers and manures contain nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, etc. These nutrients need to be added from time to time to enrich the soil. We can grow plants and keep them healthy if we can fulfil the nutrient requirement of plants. Usually crop plants absorb a lot of nitrogen and the soil becomes deficient in nitrogen. You learnt that though nitrogen gas is available in plenty in the air, plants cannot use it in the manner they can use carbon dioxide. They need nitrogen in a soluble form. The bacterium called Rhizobium can take atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a usable form. But Rhizobium cannot make its own food. So it often lives in the roots of gram, peas, moong, beans and other legumes and provides them with nitrogen. In return, the plants provide food and shelter to the bacteria. They, thus, have a symbiotic relationship. This association is of great significance for the farmers. They can reduce the use of nitrogenous fertiliser where leguminous Boojho says once his grandfather told him that his wheat fields were spoiled by a fungus. He wants to know if fungi cause diseases also. Paheli told him that many fungi like yeast and mushrooms are useful, but some fungi cause diseases in plants, animals including humans. Some fungi are also used as medicines. wet and warm things they germinate and grow. Now, can you figure out how we can protect our things from getting spoiled? Some organisms live together and share both shelter and nutrients. This relationship is called symbiosis. For example, certain fungi live inside the roots of plants. The plants provide nutrients to the fungus and, in return, the fungus provides water and certain nutrients. In organisms called lichens, a chlorophyll-containing partner, which is an alga, and a fungus live together. The fungus provides shelter, water and minerals to the alga and, in return, the alga prepares and provides food to the fungus.",

Cover a part of two leaves with these papers and secure them with paper clips (Fig. 1.9). Keep the plant in sunlight for 2\u20135 days. Observe the difference in the colour of the covered and the uncovered portions on the leaf. Perform iodine test on this leaf. Did the two parts show different results? Now take second leaf. Remove the strip and expose the covered part to the sunlight for 2\u20133 days and do the iodine test again. Describe your observations. 2. Visit a green house if there is one near your place. Observe how they grow plants. Find out how they regulate the amount of light, water and carbon dioxide to grow the plants. 3. Try growing a sweet potato just in water.

            "Page1": "Motion and Time 9 I n Class VI, you learnt about different types of motions. You learnt that a motion could be along a straight line, it could be circular or periodic. Can you recall these three types of motions? Table 9.1 gives some common examples of motions. Identify the type of motion in each case. 9.1 SLOW OR FAST We know that some vehicles move faster than others. Even the same vehicle may move faster or slower at different times. Make a list of ten objects moving along a straight path. Group the motion of these objects as slow and fast. How did you decide which object is moving slow and which one is moving fast? If vehicles are moving on a road in the same direction, we can easily tell which one of them is moving faster than the other. Let us look at the motion of vehicles moving on a road. Activity 9.1 Look at Fig. 9.1. It shows the position of some vehicles moving on a road in the same direction at some instant of time. Now look at Fig. 9.2. It shows the position of the same vehicles after some time. From your observation of the two figures, answer the following questions: Which vehicle is moving the fastest of all? Which one of them is moving the slowest of all? The distance moved by objects in a given interval of time can help us to decide which one is faster or slower. For example, imagine that you have gone to see off your friend at the bus stand. Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle at the same time as the bus begins to Table 9.1 Some examples of different types of motion Example of Type of motion motion Along a straight line/circular/ periodic Soldiers in a march past Bullock cart moving on a straight road Hands of an athlete in a race Pedal of a bicycle in motion Motion of the Earth around the Sun Motion of a swing Motion of a pendulum It is common experience that the motion of some objects is slow while that of some others is fast.",
            "Page2": "MOTION AND TIME 93 move. The distance covered by you after 5 minutes would be much smaller than that covered by the bus. Would you say that the bus is moving faster than the bicycle? We often say that the faster vehicle has a higher speed. In a 100-metre race it is easy to decide whose speed is the highest. One who takes shortest time to cover the distance of 100 metres has the highest speed. 9.2 SPEED You are probably familiar with the word speed. In the examples given above, a higher speed seems to indicate that a given distance has been covered in a shorter time, or a larger distance covered in a given time. The most convenient way to find out which of the two or more objects is moving faster is to compare the distances moved by them in a unit time. Thus, if we know the distance covered by two buses in one hour, we can tell which one is faster. We call the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of the object. When we say that a car is moving with a speed of 50 kilometres per hour, it implies that it will cover a distance of Fig. 9.2 Position of vehicles shown in Fig. 9.1 after some time Fig. 9.1 Vehicles moving in the same direction on a road 50 kilometres in one hour. However, a car seldom moves with a constant speed for one hour. In fact, it starts moving slowly and then picks up speed. So, when we say that the car has a speed of 50 kilometres per hour, we usually consider only the total distance covered by it in one hour. We do not bother whether the car has been moving with",
            "Page3": "SCIENCE 94 We can determine the speed of a given object once we can measure the time taken by it to cover a certain distance. In Class VI you learnt how to measure distances. But, how do we measure time? Let us find out. 9.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME If you did not have a clock, how would you decide what time of the day it is? Have you ever wondered how our elders could tell the approximate time of the day by just looking at shadows? How do we measure time interval of a month? A year? Our ancestors noticed that many events in nature repeat themselves after definite intervals of time. For example, they found that the sun rises everyday in the morning. The time between one sunrise and the next was called a day. Similarly, a month was measured from one new moon to the next. A year was fixed as the time taken by the earth to complete one revolution of the sun. Often we need to measure intervals of time which are much shorter than a day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the most common time measuring devices. Have you ever wondered how clocks and watches measure time? The working of clocks is rather complex. But all of them make use of some periodic motion. One of the most well-known periodic motions is that of a simple pendulum. In everyday life we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long durations of time. If the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, its motion is said to be non-uniform. On the other hand, an object moving along a straight line with a constant speed is said to be in uniform motion. In this case, the average speed is the same as the actual speed. Fig. 9.3 Some common clocks (b) Table clock (c) Digital clock (a) Wall clock a constant speed or not during that hour. The speed calculated here is actually the average speed of the car. In this book we shall use the term speed for average speed. So, for us the speed is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken. Thus, Total distance covered Speed = Total time taken",
            "Page4": "MOTION AND TIME 95 A simple pendulum consists of a small metallic ball or a piece of stone suspended from a rigid stand by a thread [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. The metallic ball is called the bob of the pendulum. Fig. 9.4 (a) shows the pendulum at rest in its mean position. When the bob of the pendulum is released after taking it slightly to one side, it begins to move to and fro [Fig. 9.4 (b)]. The to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of a periodic or an oscillatory motion. The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves To set the pendulum in motion, gently hold the bob and move it slightly to one side. Make sure that the string attached to the bob is taut while you displace it. Now release the bob from its displaced position. Remember that the bob is not to be pushed when it is released. Note the time on the clock when the bob is at its mean position. Instead of the mean position you may note the time when the bob is at one of its extreme positions. Measure the time the pendulum takes to complete 20 oscillations. Record your observations Fig. 9.4 (b) Different positions of the bob of an oscillating simple pendulum Fig. 9.4 (a) A simple pendulum to A, to B and back to O. The pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position A to the other extreme position B and comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. Activity 9.2 Set up a simple pendulum as shown in Fig. 9.4 (a) with a thread or string of length nearly one metre. Switch off any fans nearby. Let the bob of the pendulum come to rest at its mean position. Mark the mean position of the bob on the floor below it or on the wall behind it. To measure the time period of the pendulum we will need a stopwatch. However, if a stopwatch is not available, a table clock or a wristwatch can be used. A O B",

These clocks are called quartz clocks. The time measured by quartz clocks is much more accurate than that by the clocks available earlier. Units of time and speed The basic unit of time is a second. Its symbol is s. Larger units of time are minutes (min) and hours (h). You already know how these units are related to one another. What would be the basic unit of speed? Since the speed is distance/time, the basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it could also be expressed in other units such as m/min or km/h. You must remember that the symbols of all units are written in singular. For example, we write 50 km and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms. Boojho is wondering how many seconds there are in a day and how many hours in a year. Can you help him? in Table 9.2. The first observation shown is just a sample. Your observations could be different from this. Repeat this activity a few times and record your observations. By dividing the time taken for 20 oscillations by 20, get the time taken for one oscillation, or the time period of the pendulum. Is the time period of your pendulum nearly the same in all cases? Note that a slight change in the initial displacement does not affect the time period of your pendulum. Nowadays most clocks or watches have an electric circuit with one or more There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 \u20131642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were refinements of the pendulum clocks.",
            "Page6": "MOTION AND TIME 97 Different units of time are used depending on the need. For example, it is convenient to express your age in years rather than in days or hours. Similarly, it will not be wise to express in years the time taken by you to cover the distance between your home and your school. How small or large is a time interval of one second? The time taken in saying aloud \u201ctwo thousand and one\u201d is nearby one second. Verify it by counting aloud from \u201ctwo thousand and one\u201d to \u201ctwo thousand and ten\u201d. The pulse of a normal healthy adult at rest beats about 72 times in a minute that is about 12 times in 10 seconds. This rate may be slightly higher for children. Paheli wondered how time was measured when pendulum clocks were not available. Many time measuring devices were used in different parts of the world before the pendulum clocks became popular. Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks are some examples of such devices. Different designs of these devices were developed in different parts of the world (Fig. 9.5). 9.4 MEASURING SPEED Having learnt how to measure time and distance, you can calculate the speed of an object. Let us find the speed of a ball moving along the ground. Activity 9.3 Draw a straight line on the ground with chalk powder or lime and ask one of your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along the ground in a direction perpendicular to the line. Note the time at the moment the ball crosses the line and also when it comes to rest (Fig. 9.6). How much time does the ball take to come to rest? The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available that can measure time intervals smaller than a second. Some of these clocks can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond. One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the range of time intervals that we have to deal with?",
            "Page7": "SCIENCE 98 Measure the distance between the point at which the ball crosses the line and the point where it comes to rest. You can use a scale or a measuring tape. Let different groups repeat the activity. Record the measurements in Table 9.3. In each case calculate the speed of the ball. You may now like to compare your speed of walking or cycling with that of your friends. You need to know the distance of the school from your home or from some other point. Each one of you can then measure the time taken to cover that distance and calculate your speed. It may be interesting to know who amongst you is the fastest.

Table 9.4, in km/h. You can calculate the speeds in m/s yourself. Rockets, launching satellites into earth\u2019s orbit, often attain speeds up to 8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise can move only with a speed of about 8 cm/s. Can you calculate how fast is the rocket compared with the tortoise? Once you know the speed of an object, you can find the distance moved by it in a given time. All you have to do is to multiply the speed by time. Thus, Distance covered = Speed \u00d7 Time You can also find the time an object would take to cover a distance while moving with a given speed. You might have seen a meter fitted on top of a scooter or a motorcycle. Similarly, meters can be seen on the dashboards of cars, buses and other vehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboard of a car. Note that one of the meters has km/h written at one corner. This is called a speedometer. It records the Time taken = Distance/Speed Table 9.4 Fastest speed that some animals can attain S.

While going for a school picnic, Paheli decided to note the reading on the odometer of the bus after every 30 minutes till the end of the journey. Later on she recorded her readings in Table 9.5. Can you tell how far was the picnic spot from the school? Can you calculate the speed of the bus? Looking at the Table, Boojho asked Paheli whether she can tell how far they would have travelled till 9:45 AM. Paheli had no answer to this question. They went to their teacher. She told them that one way to solve this problem is to plot a distance-time graph. Let us find out how such a graph is plotted.

Draw two lines perpendicular to each other on it, as shown in Fig. 9.11. Mark the horizontal line as XOX'. It is known as the x-axis. Similarly mark the vertical line YOY'. It is called the y-axis. The point of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is known as the origin O. The two quantities between which the graph is drawn are shown along these two axes. We show the positive values on the x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive values on the y-axis are shown along OY. In this chapter we shall consider only the positive values of quantities. Therefore, we shall use only the shaded part of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11. Boojho and Paheli found out the distance travelled by a car and the time taken by it to cover that distance.

For the motion of the car scales could be Time: 1 min = 1 cm Distance: 1 km = 1 cm \uf0a7 Mark values for the time and the distance on the respective axes according to the scale you have chosen. For the motion of the car mark the time 1 min, 2 min, \u2026 on the x-axis from the origin O. Similarly, mark the distance 1 km, 2 km \u2026 on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12). \uf0a7 Now you have to mark the points on the graph paper to represent each set of values for distance and time. Observation recorded at S. No. 1 in Table 9.6 shows that at time 0 min the distance moved is also zero. The point corresponding to this set of values on the graph will therefore be the origin itself. After 1 minute, the car has moved a distance of 1 km. To mark this set of values look for the point that represents 1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line parallel to the y-axis at this point. Then draw a line parallel to the x-axis from the point corresponding to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The point where these two lines intersect represents this set of values on the graph (Fig. 9.12).

            "Page12": "MOTION AND TIME 103 Generally, the choice of scales is not as simple as in the example given in Fig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to choose two different scales to represent the desired quantities on the x-axis and the y-axis. Let us try to understand this process with an example. Let us again consider the motion of the bus that took Paheli and her friends to the picnic. The distance covered and time taken by the bus are shown in Table 9.5. The total distance covered by the bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to draw an axis of length 80 cm. This is not possible on a sheet of paper. On the other hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would require an axis of length only 8 cm. This scale is quite convenient. However, the graph may cover only a small part of the graph paper. Some of the points to be kept in mind while choosing the most suitable scale for drawing a graph are: \uf0a7 the difference between the highest and the lowest values of each quantity. \uf0a7 the intermediate values of each quantity, so that with the scale chosen it is convenient to mark the values on the graph, and \uf0a7 to utilise the maximum part of the paper on which the graph is to be drawn.

On the other hand, from the distance-time graph we can find the distance moved by the bus at any instant of time. Suppose we want to know how much distance the bus had travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on the x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point is A. Next we draw a line perpendicular to the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at point A. We then mark the point, T, on the graph at which this perpendicular line intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we draw a line through the point T parallel to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis at the point B. The distance corresponding to the point B on the y- axis, OB, gives us the distance in km covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How much is this distance in km?

Paheli and Boojho had also set up the game by connecting an electric circuit as suggested in Class VI. They had lots of fun trying it out with their families and friends. They enjoyed it so much that they decided to suggest it to a cousin of theirs who stayed in a different town. So, Paheli made a neat drawing showing how the various electric components were to be connected (Fig.10.1). Fig. 10.1 Setup to check how steady your hand is Can you draw this circuit conveniently? It made Boojho wonder if there was an easier way to represent these electric components. 10.1 SYMBOLS OF ELECTRIC COMPONENTS Some common electric components can be represented by symbols. In Table 10.1, some electric components and their symbols are shown. You may come across different symbols for these components in different books. However, in this book, we shall be using the symbols shown here. Look at the symbols carefully. In the symbol for the electric cell, notice that there is a longer line and a shorter but thicker parallel line. Do you recall that an electric cell has a positive terminal and a negative terminal? In the symbol of the electric cell, the longer line represents the positive terminal and the thicker, shorter line represents the negative terminal. For a switch the \u2018ON\u2019 position and the \u2018OFF\u2019 position are represented by the symbols as shown. The wires used to connect the various components in a circuit are represented by lines. In Table 10.1, a battery and its symbol are also shown. Do you know what a battery is? Look at the symbol of a battery. Can you make out what a battery could be? For some of the activities we may need more than one cell. So, we connect two or more cells together as shown in Fig.10.2. Notice",
            "Page2": "SCIENCE 110 Many devices such as torches, transistors, toys, TV remote controls, use batteries. However, in some of these devices the electric cells are not always placed one after the other as shown in Fig. 10.2. Sometimes the cells are placed side by side. Then how are the terminals of the cells connected? Look carefully inside the battery compartment of any device. There is usually a thick wire or a metal strip connecting the positive terminal of one cell to the negative terminal of the next cell (Fig.10.3). In order to help you to place the cells correctly in the battery compartment, \u2018+\u2019 and \u2018\u2013\u2019 symbols are usually printed there. How can we connect the cells to prepare batteries for our activities? You may make a cell holder, as shown in Fig.10.4, using a wooden block, two iron strips and rubber bands.

You could also buy cell holders from the market for making batteries of two or more electric cells. Place the cells in them properly, such that the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. Connect a piece of wire each to the two metal clips on the cell holder as shown in Fig.10.5. Your battery is ready for use. The symbol used for representing a battery is shown in Table.10.1. Let us now draw a circuit diagram of an electric circuit using symbols shown in Table 10.1. Activity 10.1 Make the electric circuit shown in Fig. 10.7. You used a similar circuit in Class VI to make an electric bulb glow. Do you remember that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the \u2018ON\u2019 position? The bulb glows as soon as the switch is moved to the \u2018ON\u2019 position. Copy this electric circuit in your notebook. Make also a circuit diagram of this circuit using symbols for the various electric components. Is your diagram similar to the one shown in Fig. 10.8? It is much easier to draw a circuit diagram using symbols. Therefore, we generally represent an electric circuit by its circuit diagram. Fig. 10.9 shows another circuit diagram. Is it identical to the circuit diagram shown in Fig.10.8? In which way is it different? Would the bulb glow in this electric circuit? Recall that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the \u2018ON\u2019 position and the electric circuit is closed. Fig. 10.4 A cell holder Fig. 10.5 Another type of cell holder Paheli and Boojho wonder whether the batteries used in tractors, trucks and inverters are also made from cells.

After moving the switch back to the \u2018OFF\u2019 position, touch the bulb again. Activity 10.3 Make a circuit as shown in Fig.10.10. Take about 10 cm long piece of nichrome wire and tie it between the nails. (You can get nichrome wire from an electric repair shop or you can use a piece of discarded coil of an electric heater.)

You may have noticed that when these appliances are switched on after CAUTION Do not keep the switch in the \u2018ON\u2019 position for a long time, otherwise the cell may become weak very quickly. Boojho could not see element in an electric iron.

The amount of heat produced in a wire depends on its material, length and thickness. Thus, for different requirements, the wires of different materials and different lengths and thicknesses are used. The wires used for making electric circuits do not normally become hot. On the other hand, the elements of some electric appliances become so hot that they are easily visible. The filament of Fig. 10.12 Glowing filament of an electric bulb (incandescent) Incandescent electric bulbs (Fig. 10.12) are often used for lighting but they also give heat. It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing heat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescent tube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient lighting sources. Nowadays, the use of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is increasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume less electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus LED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred. Fig. 10.13 Electric bulb, tube-light, CFL and LED It is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets, which are electricity efficient.

            "Page7": "ELECTRIC CURRENT AND ITS EFFECTS 115 One reason for excessive currents in electrical circuits is the direct touching of wires. This may happen if the insulation on the wires has come off due to wear and tear. This may cause a short circuit. Another reason for excessive current can be the connection of many devices to a single socket. This may cause overload in the circuit. You might have read reports in newspapers about fires caused by short circuits and overloads. buildings fuses are inserted in all electrical circuits. There is a maximum limit on the current which can safely flow through a circuit. If by accident the current exceeds this safe limit, the wires an electric bulb gets heated to such a high temperature that it starts glowing. If a large current passes through a wire, the wire may become so hot that it may even melt and break. But is it possible for a wire to melt and break? Let us check it out. Activity 10.4 Make the circuit we used for Activity 10.3 again. However, replace the cell with a battery of four cells. Also, in place of the nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly used for cleaning utensils and is available in grocery shops.) If there are any fans in the room, switch them off. Now pass the current through the circuit for sometime. Observe the strand of steel wool carefully. Note what happens. Does the strand of steel wool melt and break? Wires made from some special materials melt quickly and break when large electric currents are passed through them. These wires are used for making electric fuses (Fig.10.14). In all CAUTION Never try to investigate an electric fuse connected to mains circuit on your own. You may, however, visit an electric repair shop and compare the burnt out fuses with the new ones.

Wrap an electric wire a few times around the cardboard tray. Place a small compass needle inside it. Now connect the free ends of this wire to an electric cell through a switch as shown in Fig.10.17. Note the direction in which the compass needle is pointing. Bring a bar magnet near the compass needle. Observe what happens. Now, while watching the compass needle carefully, move the switch to the \u2018ON\u2019 position. These days Miniature circuit breakers (MCBs) are increasingly being used in place of fuses. These are switches which automatically turn off when current in a circuit exceeds the safe limit. You turn them on and the circuit is once again complete. Look for ISI mark on MCBs also.

Wind the wire tightly around the nail in the form of a coil. Connect the free ends of the wire to the terminals of a cell through a switch as shown in Fig. 10.19. Place some pins on or near the end of the nail. Now switch on the current. What happens? Do the pins cling to the tip of the nail? Switch off the current. Are the pins still clinging to the end of the nail? The coil in the above activity behaves like a magnet when electric current flows through it. When the electric current is switched off, the coil generally loses its magnetism. Such coils are called electromagnets. The electromagnets can be made very strong and can lift very heavy loads. Do you remember the crane about which you read in Chapter 10 of Class VI? The end of such a crane has a strong electromagnet attached to it. The electromagnets are also used to separate magnetic material from the junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets to take out small pieces of magnetic material that have accidentally fallen in Fig. 10.19 An electromagnet What do you observe? Does the compass needle deflect? Move the switch back to the \u2018OFF\u2019 position. Does the compass needle come back to its initial position? Repeat the experiment a few times. What does this experiment indicate? We know that the needle of a compass is a tiny magnet, which points in north-south direction. When we bring a magnet close to it, the needle gets deflected. We have also seen that compass needle gets deflected when the current flows in a nearby wire. Can you connect the two observations? When the current flows through a wire, does the wire behave like a magnet? This is what a scientist called Hans Christian Oersted (Fig. 10.18) also wondered. He was the first person who noticed the deflection of compass needle every time the current was passed through the wire. So, when electric current passes through a wire, it behaves like a magnet. This is the magnetic effect of the electric current. In fact, an electric current can be used to make magnets. Do you find it too surprising? Let us try it out. Remember not to switch on the current for more than a few seconds at a time. The electromagnet weakens the cell quickly if left connected.",

When the iron strip is in contact with the screw, the current flows through the coil which becomes an electromagnet. It, then, pulls the iron strip. In the process, the hammer at the end of the strip strikes the gong of the bell to produce a sound. However, when the electromagnet pulls the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit. The current through the coil stops flowing. Will the coil remain an electromagnet? The coil is no longer an electromagnet. It no longer attracts the iron strip. The iron strip comes back to its original position and touches the contact screw again. This completes the circuit. The current flows in the coil and the hammer strikes the gong again. This process is repeated in quick succession. The hammer strikes the gong every time the circuit is completed. This is how the bell rings.

I can also see my erect image though it is smaller in size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of some kind\u201d, said Paheli. You can also use a spoon or any curved shining surface to see your image. Activity 11.5 Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the outer side of the spoon near your face and look into it. Do you see your image in it (Fig. 11.10)? Is this image different from what you see in a plane mirror? Is this image erect? Is the size of the image the same, smaller or larger?

This time you may find that your image is erect and larger in size. If you increase the distance of the spoon from your face, you may see your image inverted (Fig. 11.11). You can also compare the image of your pen or pencil instead of your face. The curved shining surface of a spoon acts as a mirror. The most common example of a curved mirror is a spherical mirror. If the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is concave, it is called a concave mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex, then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 11.12). (a) (b)",

You might have wondered why particular types of clothes are suitable for a particular season. In winter you feel cold inside the house. If you come out in the sun, you feel warm. In summer, you feel hot even inside the house. How do we know whether an object is hot or cold? How do we find out how hot or cold an object is? In this chapter we shall try to seek answers to some of these questions. 3.1 HOT AND COLD In our day-to-day life, we come across a number of objects. Some of them are hot We see that some objects are cold while some are hot. You also know that some objects are hotter than others while some are colder than others. How do we decide which object is hotter than the other? We often do it by touching the objects. But is our sense of touch reliable? Let us find out. Activity 3.1 Take three small tubs/containers.

A clinical thermometer consists of a long, narrow, uniform glass tube. It has a bulb at one end. This bulb contains mercury. Outside the bulb, a small shining thread of mercury can be seen. If you do not see the mercury thread, rotate the thermometer a bit till you see it. You will also find a scale on the thermometer. The scale we use is the celsius scale, indicated by \u00b0C. Boojho\u2019s confusion shows that we cannot always rely on our sense of touch to decide whether an object is hot or cold. Sometimes it may deceive us. Then, how do we find out how hot an object really is? A reliable measure of the hotness of an object is its temperature. Temperature is measured by a device called thermometer. 3.2 MEASURING TEMPERATURE Have you seen a thermometer? Recall that when you or someone else in your family had fever, the temperature was measured by a thermometer. The thermometer that measures our body temperature is called a clinical thermometer.

After keeping the hands in the two containers for 2\u20133 minutes, put both the hands simultaneously in container C (Fig. 3.1). Do both the hands get the same feeling? Boojho wondered which of the two scales shown in Fig. 3.2 he should read. Paheli told him that India has adopted the celsius scale and we should read that scale. The other scale with the range 94\u2013108 degrees is the Fahrenheit scale (\u00b0F). It was in use earlier.

It could be slightly higher or slightly lower. Actually, what we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy persons. The clinical thermometer is designed to measure the temperature of human body only. The temperature of human body normally does not go below 35oC or above 42oC. That is the reason that this thermometer has the range 35oC to 42oC. Different types of thermometers are used for different purposes. The maximum and minimum temperatures of the previous day, reported in weather reports, are measured by a thermometer called the m a x i m u m - m i n i m u m thermometer. CAUTION Do not use a clinical thermometer for measuring the temperature of any object other than the human body. Also avoid keeping the thermometer in the sun or near a flame.

Do you notice that as soon as you take the thermometer out of water, the level of mercury begins to fall. This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is in water. You may recall that while taking your own temperature, you have to take the thermometer out of your mouth to note the reading.

Why does the mercury not fall or rise in a clinical thermometer when taken out of the mouth? Observe a clinical thermometer again. Do you see a kink near the bulb (Fig. 3.6). What is the use of the kink? It prevents mercury level from falling on its own. in all cases heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. How does heat flow? Let us investigate. Activity 3.6 Take a rod or flat strip of a metal, say of aluminium or iron. Fix a few small wax pieces on the rod. These pieces should be at nearly equal distances (Fig. 3.7). Clamp the rod to a stand. If you do not find a stand, you can put one end of the rod in between bricks. Now, heat the other end of the rod and observe. What happens to the wax pieces? Do these pieces begin to fall? Which piece falls the first? Do you think that heat is Fig. 3.6 A clinical thermometer has a kink in it 3.4 TRANSFER OF HEAT You might have observed that a frying pan becomes hot when kept on a flame. It is because the heat passes from the flame to the utensil. When the pan is removed from the fire, it slowly cools down. Why does it cool down? The heat is transferred from the pan to the surroundings. So you can understand that in both cases, the heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object. In fact, Paheli asks: \u201cDoes it mean that heat will not be transferred if the temperature of two objects is the same?\u201d transferred from the end nearest to the flame to the other end? The process by which heat is transferred from the hotter end to the colder end of an object is known as conduction.

You must have observed that the metallic pan for cooking has a plastic or wooden handle. Can you lift a hot pan by holding it from the handle without getting hurt? Activity 3.7 Heat water in a small pan or a beaker. Collect some articles such as a steel spoon, plastic scale, pencil and divider. Dip one end of each of these articles in hot water (Fig. 3.8). Wait for a few minutes. Touch the other end. Enter your observation in Table 3.3. The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are conductors of heat. For examples, aluminum, iron and copper. The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood. Poor conductors are known as insulators. The water and air are poor conductors of heat. Then, how does the heat transfer take place in these substances? Let us find out. Activity 3.8 Take a round bottom flask (if flask is not available, a beaker can be used). Fill it two-thirds with water. Place it on a tripod, or make some arrangement to place the flask in such a way that you can heat it by placing a candle below it. Wait till the water in the flask is still. Place a crystal of potassium permanganate at the bottom of the flask gently using a straw. Now, heat the water by placing the candle just below the crystal. Write your observation in your notebook and also draw a picture of what you observe (Fig. 3.9). When water is heated, the water near the flame gets hot. Hot water rises up. The cold water from the sides moves down towards the source of heat.

On the sides, however, there is no convection and air does not feel as hot as at the top. The people living in the coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon. During the day, the land gets heated faster than the water. The air over the land becomes hotter and rises up. The cooler air from the sea rushes in towards the land to take its place. The warm air from the land moves towards the sea to complete the cycle (Fig. 3.11). The air from the sea is called the sea breeze. To receive the cooler sea breeze, the windows of the houses in coastal areas are made to face the sea. At night it is exactly the reverse. The water cools down more slowly than the land. So, the cool air from the land moves towards the sea. This is called the land breeze. When we come out in the sun, we feel warm. How does the heat from the sun reach us? It cannot reach us by conduction or convection as there is no medium such as air in most part of the space between the earth and the sun. and water from the sides moves down. This process continues till the whole water gets heated. This mode of heat transfer is known as convection. How does the heat travel in air? In which direction does the smoke go? The air near the heat source gets hot and rises. The air from the sides comes in to take its place. In this way the air gets heated. The following activity confirms this idea. Activity 3.9 Light a candle. Keep one hand above the flame and one hand on the side of the flame (Fig. 3.10). Do your hands feel equally hot? If not which hand feels hotter? And why?

            "Page9": "SCIENCE 32 From the sun the heat comes to us by another process known as radiation. The transfer of heat by radiation does not require any medium. It can take place whether a medium is present or not. When we sit in front of a room heater, we get heat by this process. A hot utensil kept away from the flame cools down as it transfers heat to the surroundings by radiation. Our body too, gives heat to the surroundings and receives heat from it by radiation. All hot bodies radiate heat. When this heat falls on some object, a part of it is reflected, a part is absorbed and a part may be transmitted. The temperature of the object increases due to the absorbed part of the heat.

Activity 3.11 Fill the two cans used in Activity 3.10 with the same amount of hot water at the same temperature (say, at 60oC). Leave the cans in a room or in a shade. Note the temperature of water after 10\u201315 minutes. Does the temperature of water in both the cans fall by the same amount? Do these activities suggest to you the reason why it is more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured clothes in the summer and dark-coloured clothes in the winter? Dark surfaces absorb more heat and, therefore, we feel comfortable with dark coloured clothes in the winter. Light coloured clothes reflect most of the heat that falls on them and, therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them in the summer. Woollen clothes keep us warm in winter In the winter, we use woollen clothes. Wool is a poor conductor of heat. Moreover, there is air trapped in between the wool fibres. This air prevents the flow of heat from our body to the cold surroundings. So, we feel warm. Suppose you are given the choice in winter of using either one thick blanket or two thin blankets joined together. What would you choose and why? Remember that there would be a layer of air in between the blankets.

            "Page1": "Respiration in Organisms 6 O ne day Boojho was eagerly waiting to meet his grandparents who were coming to the town after a year. He was in a real hurry as he wanted to receive them at the bus-stop. He ran fast and reached the bus-stop in a few minutes. He was breathing rapidly. His grandmother asked him why he was breathing so fast. Boojho told her that he came running all the way. But the question got stuck in his mind. He wondered why running makes a person breathe faster. The answer to Boojho\u2019s question lies in understanding why we breathe. Breathing is a part of respiration. Let us learn about respiration. 6.1 WHY DO WE RESPIRE? In Chapter 2 you learnt that all organisms are made of small microscopic units called cells. A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Each cell of an organism performs certain functions such as nutrition, transport, excretion and reproduction. To perform these functions, the cell needs energy. Even when we are eating, sleeping or reading we require energy. But, where does this energy come from? Can you say why your parents insist that you should eat regularly? The food has stored energy, which is released during respiration. Therefore, all living organisms respire to get energy from food. During breathing, we breathe in air. You know that air contains oxygen. We breathe out air which is rich in carbon dioxide. The air we breathe in is transported to all parts of the body and ultimately to each cell. In the cells, oxygen in the air helps in the breakdown of food. The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release of energy is called cellular respiration. Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of all organisms. In the cell, the food (glucose) is broken down into carbon dioxide and water using oxygen. When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration. Food can also be broken down, without using oxygen. This is called anaerobic respiration. Breakdown of food releases energy. You should know that there are some organisms such as yeast that can survive in the absence of air. They are called anaerobes. They get energy through anaerobic respiration. In the absence of oxygen, glucose breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide, as given below:",
            "Page2": "SCIENCE 58 Our muscle cells can also respire anaerobically, but only for a short time, when there is a temporary deficiency of oxygen. During heavy exercise, fast running (Fig. 6.1), cycling, walking for many hours or heavy weight lifting, the demand for energy is high. But the supply of oxygen to produce the energy is limited. Then anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil the demand of energy: Fig. 6.1 During exercise, some muscles may respire anaerobically Have you ever wondered why you get muscle cramps after heavy exercise? The cramps occur when muscle cells respire anaerobically. The partial breakdown of glucose produces lactic acid. The accumulation of lactic acid causes muscle cramps. We get relief from cramps after a hot water bath or a massage. Can you guess why it is so? Hot water bath or massage improves circulation of blood. As a result, the supply of oxygen to the muscle cells increases. The increase in the supply of oxygen results in the complete breakdown of lactic acid into carbon dioxide and water. 6.2 BREATHING Activity 6.1 Yeasts are single-celled organisms. They respire anaerobically and during this process yield alcohol. They are, therefore, used to make wine and beer. CAUTION Do this activity under the supervision of your teacher. Close your nostrils and mouth tightly and look at a watch. What did you feel after some time? How long were you able to keep both of them closed? Note down the time for which you could hold your breath (Fig. 6.2). So, now you know that you cannot survive for long without breathing. Breathing means taking in air rich in oxygen and giving out air rich in carbon dioxide with the help of respiratory organs. The taking in of air rich in oxygen into the body is called inhalation and giving out of air rich in carbon dioxide is known as exhalation. It is a continuous process which goes",

Activity 6.2 Generally we are not aware that we are breathing. However, if you try you can count your rate of breathing. Breathe in and out normally. Find out how many times you breathe in and breathe out in a minute? Did you inhale the same number of times as you exhaled? Now count your breathing rate (number of breaths/minute) after brisk walk and after running. Record your breathing rate as soon as you finish and also after complete rest. Tabulate your findings and compare your breathing rates under different conditions with those of your classmates. From the above activity, you must have realised that whenever a person needs extra energy, he/she breathes faster. As a result more oxygen is Boojho noticed that when he released his breath after holding it for some time, he had to breathe heavily. Can you tell him why it was so?

Does this explain why do we feel hungry after a physical activity? When you feel drowsy, does your breathing rate slow down? Does your body receive sufficient oxygen? Activity 6.3 Figure 6.3 shows the various activities carried out by a person during a normal day. Can you say in which activity, the rate of breathing will be the slowest and in which it will be the fastest? Assign numbers to the pictures in the order of increasing rate of breathing according to your experience. 6.3 HOW DO WE BREATHE? Let us now learn about the mechanism of breathing. Normally we take in air through our nostrils. When we inhale air, it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity. From the nasal cavity, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe. Lungs are present in the chest cavity (Fig. 6.4). This cavity is surrounded by ribs on the sides. A large, muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the floor of the chest cavity (Fig. 6.4). Breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and the rib cage. During inhalation, ribs move up and outwards and diaphragm moves down. This movement increases space in our chest cavity and air rushes into the lungs. The lungs get filled with air. During exhalation, ribs move down and inwards, while diaphragm moves up to its former position. This reduces the size of the chest cavity and air is pushed out of the lungs (Fig. 6.5). These movements in our body can be felt easily. Take a On an average, an adult human being at rest breathes in and out 15\u201318 times in a minute. During heavy exercise, the breathing rate can increase upto 25 times per minute. While we exercise, not only do we breathe fast, we also take deep breaths and thus inhale more oxygen. Paheli wants to know why we yawn when we are sleepy or drowsy.",

Everyone was boasting that she/he Fig 6.4 Human respiratory system The air around us has various types of unwanted particles, such as smoke, dust, pollens, etc. When we inhale, the particles get trapped in the hair present in our nasal cavity. However, sometimes these particles may get past the hair in the nasal cavity. This may irritate the lining of the cavity, as a result of which we sneeze. Sneezing expels these foreign particles from the inhaled air and a dust- free, clean air enters our body. TAKE CARE: When you sneeze, you should cover your nose so that the foreign particles you expel are not inhaled by other persons. Smoking damages lungs. Smoking is also linked to cancer.

How do other organisms breathe? Do they also have lungs like those of human beings? Let us find out. Cockroach: A cockroach has small openings on the sides of its body. Other insects also have similar openings. Boojho wants to know if cockroaches, snails, fish, earthworms, ants and mosquitoes also have lungs. These openings are called spiracles (Fig. 6.9). Insects have a network of air tubes called tracheae for gas exchange. Oxygen rich air rushes through spiracles into the tracheal tubes, diffuses into the body tissue, and reaches every cell of the body. Similarly, carbon dioxide from the cells goes into the tracheal tubes and moves out through spiracles. These air tubes or tracheae are found only in insects and not in any other group of animals.

How do they breathe under water? You have studied in Class VI that gills in fish help them to use oxygen dissolved in water. Gills are projections of the skin. You may wonder how gills help in breathing. Gills are well supplied with blood vessels (Fig. 6.10) for exchange of gases. Boojho has seen in television programmes that whales and dolphins often come up to the water surface. They even release a fountain of water sometimes while moving upwards. Why do they do so? 6.7 DO PLANTS ALSO RESPIRE? Like other living organisms, plants also respire for their survival as you have learnt in Class VI. They also take in oxygen from the air and give out carbon Like all other living cells of the plants, the root cells also need oxygen to generate energy.

            "Page1": "Transportation in Animals and Plants 7 Y ou have learnt earlier that all organisms need food, water and oxygen for survival. They need to transport all these to various parts of their body. Further, animals need to transport wastes to parts from where they can be removed. Have you wondered how all this is achieved? Look at Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and the blood vessels? They function to transport substances and together form the circulatory system. In this chapter, you shall learn about transport of substances in animals and plants. 7.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM Blood What happens when you get a cut on your body? Blood flows out. But what is blood? Blood is the fluid which flows in blood vessels. It transports substances like digested food from the small intestine to the other parts of the body. It carries oxygen from the lungs to the cells of the body. It also transports waste for removal from the body. How does the blood carry various substances? Blood is composed of a fluid, called plasma in which different types of cells are suspended. Heart Vein Artery Why is the colour of blood red? Fig. 7.1 Circulatory system (Arteries are shown in red colour and veins in blue)",
            "Page2": "TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 71 One type of cells are the red blood cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin binds with oxygen and transports it to all the parts of the body and ultimately to all the cells. It will be difficult to provide oxygen efficiently to all the cells of the body without haemoglobin. The presence of haemoglobin makes blood appear red. The blood also has white blood cells (WBC) which fight against germs that may enter our body. Boojho fell down while playing a game and his knee got injured. Blood was coming out from the cut. After some time, he noticed that bleeding had stopped and a dark red clot had plugged the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this. The clot is formed because of the presence of another type of cells in the blood, called platelets. Blood vessels There are different types of blood vessels in the body. You know that during inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported to the rest of the body. Also, the blood picks up the waste materials including carbon dioxide from the cells. This blood has to go back to the heart for transport to the lungs for removal of carbon dioxide as you have learnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of blood vessels, arteries and veins are present in the body. (Fig. 7.1) Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to all parts of the body. Since the blood flow is rapid and at a high pressure, the arteries have thick elastic walls. Let us perform an activity to study the flow of blood through arteries. Activity 7.1 Place the middle and index finger of your right hand on the inner side of your left wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some throbbing movements? Why do you think there is throbbing? This throbbing is called the pulse and it is due to the blood flowing in the arteries. Count the number of pulse beats in one minute. How many pulse beats could you count? The number of beats per minute is called the pulse rate. A resting person, usually has a pulse rate between 72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other places in your body where you can feel the pulse. Record your own pulse beats per minute and those of your classmates. Insert the values you obtained in Table 7.1 and compare them. Fig. 7.2 Pulse in the wrist",
            "Page3": "SCIENCE 72 Table 7.1 Pulse rate S. No. Name Pulse per minute 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Paheli explained that the pulmonary artery carries blood from the heart, so it is called an artery and not a vein. It carries carbon dioxide-rich blood to the lungs. Pulmonary vein carries oxygen-rich blood from the lungs to the heart. Veins are the vessels which carry carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts of the body back to the heart. The veins have thin walls. There are valves present in veins which allow blood to flow only towards the heart. Refer to Fig. 7.3. Do you see the arteries divide into smaller vessels? On reaching the tissues, they divide further into extremely thin tubes called capillaries. The capillaries join to form veins which empty into the heart. Heart The heart is an organ which beats continuously to act as a pump for the transport of blood, which carries other substances with it. Imagine a pump working for years without stopping! Absolutely impossible. Yet our heart works like a pump non-stop. Let us now learn about the heart. The heart is located in the chest cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted towards the left (Fig. 7.1). Hold your fingers inwards on your palm. That Capillaries Vein Artery Heart Lungs I am confused! I have learnt that an artery always carries oxygen-rich blood. Pulmonary artery Pulmonary vein Fig. 7.3 Schematic diagram of circulation Blood Donation Hundreds of people die due to unavailability of blood. Voluntary blood donation is harmless and painless and can save precious lives. Blood can be donated at hospitals and other places authorised by the government. Donated blood are stored with special care in Blood Banks.",

What will happen if the blood rich in oxygen and the blood rich in carbon dioxide mix with each other? To avoid this from happening, the heart has four chambers. The two upper chambers are called the atria (singular: atrium) and the two lower chambers are called the ventricles (Fig. 7.4). The partition between the chambers helps to avoid Paheli wonders which side of the heart will have oxygen-rich blood and which side will have carbon dioxide-rich blood. Fig. 7.4 Sections of human heart Vena Cava Right atrium Right ventricle Partition completely separating the two halves Left atrium Left ventricle Pulmonary artery Pulmonary vein mixing up of blood rich in oxygen with the blood rich in carbon dioxide.

These arrows show the direction of the blood flow from the heart Aorta",
            "Page5": "SCIENCE 74 to the lungs and back to the heart from where it is pumped to the rest of the body. Heartbeat The walls of the chambers of the heart are made up of muscles. These muscles contract and relax rhythmically. This rhythmic contraction followed by its relaxation constitute a heartbeat. Remember that heartbeats continue every moment of our life. If you place your hand on the left side of your chest, you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor feels your heartbeats with the help of an instrument called a stethoscope. A doctor uses the stethoscope as a device to amplify the sound of the heart. It consists of a chest piece that carries a sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and a tube joining the parts. Doctors can get clues about the condition of your heart by listening through a stethoscope. Let us construct a model of a stethoscope with the materials that are available around us. Activity 7.2 Take a small funnel of 6\u20137 cm in diameter. Fix a rubber tube (50 cm long) tightly on the stem of the funnel. Stretch a rubber sheet (or a balloon) on the mouth of the funnel and fix it tightly with a rubber band. Put the open end of the tube on one of your ears. Place Table 7.2 Heartbeat and pulse rate Name of student While resting After running (4\u20135 minutes) Heartbeat Pulse rate Heartbeat Pulse rate Fig. 7.5 Instrument to hear heartbeat (a) Stethoscope (b) Model of stethoscope Chest Piece Ear Piece Tube",
            "Page6": "TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 75 the mouth of the funnel on your chest near the heart. Now try to listen carefully. Do you hear a regular thumping sound ? The sound is that of heart beats. How many times did your heart beat in a minute ? Count again after running for 4\u20135 minutes. Compare your observations. Record your own pulse rate and heart beat and that of your friends while resting and after running and record in Table 7.2. Do you find any relationship between your heart beat and pulse rate? Each heart beat generates one pulse in the arteries and the pulse rate per minute indicates the rate of heart beat. The rhythmic beating of the various chambers of the heart maintain circulation of blood and transport of substances to the different parts of the body. Boojho wonders if sponges and hydra also have blood? Animals such as sponges and Hydra do not possess any circulatory system. The water in which they live brings food and oxygen as it enters their bodies. The water carries away waste materials and carbon dioxide as it moves out. Thus, these animals do not need a circulatory fluid like the blood. Let us now learn about the removal of waste other than carbon dioxide. 7.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS Recall how carbon dioxide is removed as waste from the body through the lungs during exhalation. Also recall that the undigested food is removed during egestion. Let us now find out how the other waste materials are removed from the body. You may wonder where these unwanted materials come from! When our cells perform their functions, certain waste products are released. These are toxic and hence need to be removed from the body. The process of removal of wastes produced in the cells of the living organisms is called excretion. The parts involved in excretion form the excretory system. Excretory system in humans The waste which is present in the blood has to be removed from the body. How can this be done? A mechanism to filter the blood is required. This is done by the blood capillaries in the kidneys. When the blood reaches the two kidneys, it contains both useful and harmful substances. The useful substances are absorbed back into the blood. The wastes dissolved in water are removed as urine. From the kidneys, the urine goes into the urinary bladder through The English physician, William Harvey (A.D.1578\u20131657), discovered the circulation of blood. The current opinion in those days was that blood oscillates in the vessels of the body. For his views, Harvey was ridiculed and was called \u201ccirculator\u201d. He lost most of his patients. However, before he died, Harvey\u2019s idea about circulation was generally accepted as a biological fact.",
            "Page7": "SCIENCE 76 Sometimes a person\u2019s kidneys may stop working due to infection or injury. As a result of kidney failure, waste products start accumulating in the blood. Such persons cannot survive unless their blood is filtered periodically through an artificial kidney. This process is called dialysis. tube-like ureters. It is stored in the bladder and is passed out through the urinary opening at the end of a muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 7.6). The kindeys, ureters, bladder and urethra form the excretory system. An adult human being normally passes about 1\u20131.8 L of urine in 24 hours. The urine consists of 95% water, 2.5% urea and 2.5% other waste products. We have all experienced that we sweat on a hot summer day. The sweat Paheli wants to know whether other animals also urinate? The way in which waste chemicals are removed from the body of the animal depends on the availability of water. Aquatic animals like fishes, excrete cell waste as ammonia which directly dissolves in water. Some land animals like birds, lizards, snakes excrete a semi-solid, white coloured compound (uric acid). The major excretory product in humans is urea. Fig. 7.6 Human excretory system Kidney Ureter Urinary bladder Urethra contains water and salts. Boojho has seen that sometimes in summer, white patches are formed on our clothes, especially in areas like underarms. These marks are left by salts present in the sweat. Does sweat serve any other function? We know that the water kept in an earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is because the water evaporates from the pores of the pot, which causes cooling. Urinary opening",
            "Page8": "TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 77 Similarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool our body. 7.3 TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES IN PLANTS In Chapter 1 you learnt that plants take water and mineral nutrients from the soil through the roots and transport it to the leaves. The leaves prepare food for the plant, using water and carbon dioxide during photosynthesis. You also learnt in Chapter 6 that food is the source of energy and every cell of an organism gets energy by the breakdown of glucose. The cells use this energy to carry out vital activities of life. Therefore food must be made available to every cell of an organism. Have you ever wondered how water and nutrients absorbed by the root are transported to the leaves? How is the food prepared by the leaves carried to the parts which cannot make food? Transport of water and minerals Plants absorb water and minerals by the roots. The roots have root hair. The root hair increase the surface area of the root for the absorption of water and mineral nutrients dissolved in water. The root hair is in contact with the water present between the soil particles [Fig. 7.7 (a)]. Can you guess how water moves from the root to the leaves? What kind of transport system is present in plants? Boojho thinks that plants may have pipes to transport water to the entire plant like we have in our homes for the supply of water. (a) (b) Xylem vessels Fig. 7.7 Transport of water and minerals in (a) a section of root, (b) a tree Root hair",
            "Page9": "SCIENCE 78 Well, Boojho is right. Plants have pipe-like vessels to transport water and nutrients from the soil. The vessels are made of special cells, forming the vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of cells that perform specialised function in an organism. The vascular tissue for the transport of water and nutrients in the plant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)]. The xylem forms a continuous network of channels that connects roots to the leaves through the stem and branches and thus transports water to the entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)]. Paheli says her mother puts ladyfinger and other vegetables in water if they are somewhat dry. She wants to know how water enters into them. Boojho wants to know why plants absorb a large quantity of water from the soil, then give it off by transpiration! Fig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water Does any part of the herb appear red? If yes, how do you think the colour reached there? You can cut the stem across and look for the red colour inside the stem (Fig. 7.8(b) and 7.8(c)). From this activity we see that water moves up the stem. In other words, stem conducts water. Just like the red ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up the stem, along with water. Water and minerals go to leaves and other plant parts, through narrow tubes (xylem) inside the stem (Fig. 7.7(b)). You know that leaves synthesise food. The food has to be transported to all parts of the plant. This is done by the vascular tissue called the phloem. Thus, xylem and phloem transport substances in plants. Activity 7.3 We would require a glass tumbler, water, red ink, a tender herb (e.g., Balsam), and a blade for this activity. Pour water to fill one-third of the tumbler. Add a few drops of red ink to the water. Cut the base of the stem of the herb and place it in the glass as shown in Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.

            "Page10": "TRANSPORTATION IN ANIMALS AND PLANTS 79 What you have learnt \uf06e In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food and oxygen to different cells of the body.

Transpiration In Class VI you learnt that plants release a lot of water by the process of transpiration. Plants absorb mineral nutrients and water from the soil. Not all the water absorbed is utilised by the plant. The water evaporates through the stomata present on the surface of the leaves by the process of transpiration. The evaporation of water from leaves generates a suction pull (the same that you produce when you suck water through a straw) which can pull water to great heights in the tall trees. Transpiration also cools the plant.

For example, your mother may ask you to dissolve sugar in water to make a cold drink. Making a sugar solution is a change. Similarly, setting curd from milk is a change. Sometimes milk becomes sour. Souring of milk is a change. Stretched rubber band also represents a change. Make a list of ten changes you have noticed around you. In this chapter we shall perform some activities and study the nature of these changes. Broadly, these changes are of two kinds, physical and chemical. Fig. 5.1 Paper pieces 5.1 PHYSICAL CHANGES Activity 5.1 Cut a piece of paper in four square pieces. Cut each square piece further into four square pieces. Lay these pieces on the floor or a table so that the pieces acquire the shape of the original piece of paper (Fig. 5.1). Obviously, you cannot join the pieces back to make the original piece, but is there a change in the property of the paper? Activity 5.2 Collect the chalk dust lying on the floor near the chalkboard in your classroom. Or, crush a small piece of chalk into dust. Add a little water to the dust to make a paste. Roll it into the shape of a piece of chalk. Let it dry. Did you recover chalk from the dust? Activity 5.3 Take some ice in a glass or plastic tumbler. Melt a small portion of ice by placing the tumbler in the sun. You have now a mixture of ice and water. Now place the tumbler in a freezing mixture (ice plus common salt).

Properties such as shape, size, colour and state of a substance are called its physical properties. A change in which a substance undergoes a change in its physical properties is called a physical change. A physical change is generally reversible. In such a change no new substance is formed. Let us now consider the other kind of change. 5.2 CHEMICAL CHANGE A change with which you are quite familiar is the rusting of iron. If you leave a piece of iron in the open for some time, it acquires a film of brownish substance. This substance is called rust and the process is called rusting (Fig. 5.2). Iron gates of parks or farmlands, iron benches kept in lawns and gardens, almost every article of iron, kept in the open gets rusted. At home you must have seen shovels and spades getting rusted when exposed to the Activity 5.4 Boil some water in a container. Do you see the steam rising from the surface of water? Hold an inverted pan by its handle over the steam at some distance from the boiling water. Observe the inner surface of the pan. Do you see any droplet of water there? Activity 5.5 Fig. 5.2 Rusting iron CAUTION Be careful while handling a flame. Hold a used hack-saw blade with a pair of tongs. Keep the tip of the free end of the blade on the gas stove. Wait for a few minutes. Does the colour of the tip of the blade change? Remove the blade from the flame. Observe the tip once again after some time. Does it get back its original colour?

The change can be represented by the following equation: Magnesium (Mg) + Oxygen (O2) \uf0ae Magnesium oxide (MgO) Fig. 5.3 Magnesium ribbon burning atmosphere for some time. In the kitchen, a wet iron pan (tawa) often gets rusted if left in that state for some time. Rust is not iron. It is different from iron on which it gets deposited. Let us consider a few more changes where new substances are formed. Activity 5.6 (To be demonstrated by the teacher) CAUTION It is dangerous to look for long at the burning magnesium ribbon. The teachers should advise children not to stare at the burning ribbon. Get a small piece of a thin strip or ribbon of magnesium. Clean its tip with sandpaper. Bring the tip near a candle flame. It burns with a brilliant white Collect the ash and mix it with a small amount of water. Stir the mixture (aqueous solution) well. Test the mixture with blue and red litmus papers. Does the mixture turn red litmus blue? Does the mixture turn blue litmus red? On the basis of this test, how do you classify the aqueous solution \u2014 acidic or basic? On dissolving the ash in water it forms a new substance. This change can be written in the form of the following equation: Magnesium oxide (MgO) + Water (H2O) \uf0ae\uf020Magnesium hydroxide [Mg(OH)2] As you have already learnt in Chapter 4, magnesium hydroxide is a base. So, magnesium oxide is a new substance formed on burning of magnesium. Magnesium hydroxide is another new The equations here are different from those in mathematics.

Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to the solution. You should get a blue coloured solution. Save a small sample of the solution in a test tube or a small glass bottle. Drop a nail or a used shaving blade into the remaining solution. Wait for half an hour or so. Observe the colour of the solution. Compare it with the colour of the sample solution saved separately (Fig. 5.4). colour of the solution from blue to green is due to the formation of iron sulphate, a new substance. The brown deposit on the iron nail is copper, another new substance. We can write the reaction as: Copper sulphate solution (blue) + Iron \uf0ae Iron sulphate solution (green) + Copper (brown deposit) Activity 5.8 Take about a teaspoonful of vinegar in a test tube. Add a pinch of baking soda to it. You would hear a hissing sound and see bubbles of a gas coming out. Pass this gas through freshly prepared lime water as shown in Fig. 5.5. What happens to the lime water? Do you see any change in the colour of the solution? Take out the nail or the blade. Has it changed in any way? The changes that you notice are due to a reaction between copper sulphate and iron.

The turning of lime water into milky is a standard test of carbon dioxide. You will use it in Chapter 6 to show that the air we breathe out is rich in carbon dioxide. In Activities 5.6\u20135.8, you saw that in each change one or more new substances were formed. In Activity 5.6, the ash was the new substance formed when magnesium was burnt in air. In Activity 5.7, the reaction of copper sulphate with iron produced iron sulphate and copper. Both of these are new substances. Copper was deposited on the shaving blade of iron. In Activity 5.8, vinegar and baking soda together produced carbon dioxide, which turned lime water milky. Can you name the new substance formed in this reaction? A change in which one or more new substances are formed is called a chemical change. A chemical change is also called a chemical reaction. Chemical changes are very important in our lives. All new substances are formed as a result of chemical changes. For example, digestion of food in our body, ripening of fruits, fermentation of grapes, etc., happen due to series of chemical changes. A medicine is the end product of a chain of chemical reactions. Useful new materials, such as plastics and detergents, are produced by chemical reactions. Indeed, every new material is discovered by studying chemical changes. We have seen that one or more new substances are produced in a chemical change. In addition to new products, the following may accompany a chemical change: \uf06eHeat, light or any other radiation (ultraviolet, for example) may be given off or absorbed. \uf06eSound may be produced. \uf06eA change in smell may take place or a new smell may be given off. \uf06eA colour change may take place . \uf06eA gas may be formed.

If you have not seen this change in colour, cut a fresh slice of apple and keep it away for some time. Repeat the same activity with a slice of potato or brinjal. The change of colour in these cases is due to the formation of new substances. Are not these changes chemical changes? In Chapter 4, you neutralised an acid with a base. Is neutralisation a chemical change? 5.3 RUSTING OF IRON Let us get back to rusting. This is one change that affects iron articles and slowly destroys them. Since iron is used in making bridges, ships, cars, truck bodies and many other articles, the monetary loss due to rusting is huge. The process of rusting can be represented by the following equation: Iron (Fe) + Oxygen (O2, from the air) + water (H2O) \uf0ae\uf020rust (iron oxide Fe2O3) For rusting, the presence of both oxygen and water (or water vapour) is essential. In fact, if the content of moisture in air is high, which means if it is more humid, rusting becomes faster. So, how do we prevent rusting? Prevent iron articles from coming in contact with oxygen, or water, or both. One simple way is to apply a coat of paint or grease. In fact, these coats should be applied regularly to prevent rusting. Another way is to deposit a layer of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron. A protective shield You must have heard of the ozone layer in our atmosphere. It protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation which come from the sun. Ozone absorbs this radiation and breaks down to oxygen. Oxygen is different from ozone. Can we call the breaking down of ozone a chemical change? If ultraviolet radiation were not absorbed by ozone, it would reach the earth\u2019s surface and cause harm to us and other life forms. Ozone acts as a natural shield against this radiation. We learnt in Chapter 1 that plants produce their food by a process called photosynthesis. Can we call photosynthesis a chemical change? Paheli said that even digestion is a chemical change.",
            "Page7": "PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL CHANGES 53 Copper sulphate Crystals This process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation. The iron pipes we use in our homes to carry water are galvanised to prevent rusting. You know that ships are made of iron and a part of them remains under water. On the part above water also, water drops keep clinging to the ship\u2019s outer surface. Moreover, the water of the sea contains many salts. The salt water makes the process of rust formation faster. Therefore, ships suffer a lot of damage from rusting in spite of being formed from their solutions. The process is called crystallisation. It is an example of a physical change. Activity 5.9 (To be performed in the presence of the teacher) Stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium, nickel and manganese. It does not rust. Oh, that is why my friend Rita is always complaining about iron articles rusting so fast. She lives near the coast. CAUTION Use only dilute sulphuric acid. Be careful while boiling water. painted. So much so, that a fraction of ship\u2019s iron has to be replaced every year. Can you imagine the monetary loss to the world? 5.4 CRYSTALLISATION In Class VI you have learnt that salt can be obtained by the evaporation of sea water. The salt obtained in this manner is not pure and the shape of its crystals cannot be seen clearly. However, large crystals of pure substances can be Take a cupful of water in a beaker and add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid. Heat the water. When it starts boiling add copper sulphate powder slowly while stirring continuously (Fig. 5.6). Continue adding copper sulphate powder till no more powder can be dissolved. Filter the solution. Allow it to cool. Do not disturb the solution when it is cooling. Look at the solution after some time. Can you see the crystals of copper sulphate? If not, wait for some more time.

Prof Ahmad was a scientist working in the university. The children started playing while Prof Ahmad sat on a bench in the corner. He was tired as he had participated in the golden jubilee celebrations of the town. After a while, the children also came and sat around him. They wanted to know about the celebrations. Prof Ahmad told them that after the cultural programme, the senior people discussed the town\u2019s unemployment problem. A plan was proposed to put up a factory by clearing an area of the forest just outside the town. This would give the increasing population of the town a chance to get jobs. The children were very surprised when Prof Ahmad told them that many people had objected to this idea. \u201cThis is because the forests serve as green lungs and water purifying systems in nature\u201d, Prof Ahmad explained. The children were confused. Prof Ahmad realised that the children had not visited a forest. The children also wanted to know more about the forest, so they decided to visit it with Prof Ahmad. 12.1 VISIT TO A FOREST One Sunday morning, the children packed a few things like a knife, a hand lens, a stick, a notebook and walked together through a forest trail near a village. On their way, they met Tibu, a young boy of their age group, of nearby village, who was taking cattle for grazing along with his aunt. He was very agile, running here and there to keep the herd together. When he saw the children, Tibu also started walking along with them, while his aunt went on a different path. As soon as they entered the forest Tibu raised his hand and signalled them to keep quiet because noise could disturb the animals living in the forest. Tibu then took them to a place at a height to show them the broad view of the forest. Children were surprised because they could not see any land (Fig. 12.1). The different treetops had formed green cover over the land. However, the cover was not uniformly green. The Fig. 12.1 A view of a forest",

While coming down, they got excited on hearing a sudden sound of birds and some noise from the top branches of the trees. Tibu told them to relax since it was a normal phenomenon here. Because of the children\u2019s presence, some monkeys had climbed higher up on the trees where they disturbed the birds. Animals often give this type of warning call to alert other animals. Tibu also told that many other animals like boar, bison, jackals, porcupine, elephants live in the deeper areas of the forest (Fig. 12.2). Prof Ahmad cautioned children that they should not go deep into the forest. Boojho and Paheli remembered that they have studied about forests as Fig. 12.2 Some forest animals Fig. 12.3 Forest as habitat an example of a habitat in Class VI (Fig. 12.3). They could see now how the forest provides a home for many animals and plants.",

Tibu helped them to identify sal, teak, semal, sheesham, neem, palash, fig, khair, amla, bamboo, kachnar (Fig. 12.4). Prof Ahmad pointed out that there are several other trees, shrubs, herbs and grasses in the forest. The forest floor and the trees were also covered with different types of creepers and climbers. The sun was barely visible through the leaves of the trees, making it quite dark inside the forest. Activity 12.1 Observe the various things in your home and make a list of those which are made from material which may have been obtained from the forest. You might have many wooden items on your list like plywood, fuel wood, boxes, paper, matchsticks, and furniture.

The forest floor provides favourable conditions for them to germinate and develop into seedlings Prof Ahmad asked children to look up and observe how the branches of the tall trees look like a roof over the other plants in the forest. He told them that this is called a canopy (Fig. 12.7). Activity 12.2 Visit a forest or a park in your neighbourhood. Observe the trees and try to identify them. You can take the help of some elders or books on trees. List the characteristics of the trees that you observe, such as the height, shape of leaves, crown, flowers, and fruits. Also draw the crowns of some trees. Prof Ahmad pointed out that trees had crowns of different types and sizes. These had created different horizontal layers in the forest. These are known as understoreys (Fig. 12.7). Giant and tall trees constituted the top layer followed by shrubs and tall grasses, and herbs formed the lowest layer.

They came across numerous insects, spiders, squirrels, ants and various other small animals on the bark of the trees, plant leaves and on decaying leaves on the forest floor (Fig. 12.8). They started making sketches of these creatures. The forest floor seemed dark coloured and was covered with a layer of dead and decaying leaves, fruits, seeds, twigs and small herbs. The decaying matter was moist and warm. Children picked up various seeds and leaves for their collection. Walking over the dead leaf layer on the forest floor was like walking over a spongy carpet! Is the decaying matter always warm? Prof Ahmad suggested that the children could perform an activity to get an answer to this question. Fig. 12.7 Canopy and under storeys in a forest \u201cWould we see similar kind of trees in every forest?\u201d \u2014 asked Boojho. Prof Ahmad said, \u201cNo, due to different climatic conditions there are variations in the types of trees and other plants. The types of animals also differ from forest to forest.\u201d A few children were busy watching beautiful butterflies fluttering here and there on the flowers of shrubs and herbs.

Also, there are many forest like this. What difference will it make if we cut some trees for a factory?\u201d Prof Ahmad said, \u201cYou have read about autotrophs, heterotrophs and saprotrophs. You have learnt how green plants produce food. All animals, whether herbivores or carnivores, depend ultimately on plants for food. Organisms which feed on plants often get eaten by other organisms, and so on. For example, grass is eaten by insects, which in turn, is taken by the frog. The frog is consumed by snakes. This is said to form a food chain: Grass\uf0ae insects \uf0ae frog \uf0ae snake\uf0ae eagle. Many food chains can be found in the forest. All food chains are linked. If any one food chain is disturbed, it affects other food chains. Every part of the forest is dependent on the other parts.

Prof Ahmad explained that plants release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis. The plants help to provide oxygen for animal respiration. They also maintain the Prof Ahmad asked children to pick up leaves from the forest floor and observe them under a hand lens. They found tiny mushrooms over the decaying leaves. They also saw an army of tiny insects, millipedes, ants and beetle on them. They were wondering how these organisms live there. Prof Ahmad explained that apart from these animals which are easily seen, there are several organisms and micro-organisms that live in the soil. Paheli wondered what mushroom and other micro-organisms eat. Prof Ahmad replied that they feed upon the dead plant and animal tissues and convert them into a dark coloured substance called humus. In which layer of the soil would you find humus? What is its importance to the soil? The micro-organisms which convert the dead plants and animals to humus are known as decomposers. These micro-organisms play an important role in the forest. Soon, Paheli removed some dead leaves and discovered under them a layer of humus on forest floor. The presence of humus ensures that the nutrients of the dead plants and animals are released into the soil. From there, these nutrients are again absorbed by the roots of the living plants. \u201cWhat happens if an animal dies in the forest?\u201d Sheila asked. Tibu replied the dead animals become food for vultures, crows, jackals and insects.\u201d In this way, the nutrients are cycled. So, nothing goes waste in a forest (Fig. 12.9).

That is why forests are called lungs. The children saw clouds forming in the sky. Boojho recalled what he had learnt about the water cycle in Class VI. Trees take in water from their roots and release water vapour into the air through evaporation. If there were fewer trees, how will the water cycle be affected? Tibu told them that the forest is not just home to plants and animals. Many people also live in the forest. Some of",

The forest provides them with food, shelter, water and medicines. They have traditional knowledge about many medicinal plants in the forest. While Boojho was drinking water from a small stream, he saw some deer crossing the stream (Fig. 12.11). They disappeared into the bushes. The dense bushes and the tall grass provide animals with the food and shelter. They showed the children droppings of some animals, and explained the difference between various types of droppings. Prof Ahmad informed them that the forest officers could recognise the presence of some animals in the forest by their droppings and footprints. Boojho called every one and showed them a large, decaying heap of animal dropping. Several beetles and grubs were feeding on the heap and a bunch of seedlings was sprouting. \u201cThese seedlings are of the herbs and shrubs. Paheli remembered that she saw a Pipal sapling on the sidewall in her school. Can you help her to understand how this would have happened?

Soon he called and The animals also disperse the seeds of certain plants and help the forest to grow and regenerate. The decaying animal dung also provides nutrients to the seedlings to grow\u201d, said Prof Ahmad. After listening to this, Boojho noted in his notebook, \u201cBy harbouring greater variety of plants, the forest provides greater opportunities for food and habitat for the herbivores. Larger number of herbivores means increased availability of food for a variety of Fig. 12.11 Deer in a forest",

Tibu suggested another route for going back. While they were going back, it started raining. However, surprisingly, they saw that the raindrops were not hitting the forest floor directly. The uppermost layer of the forest canopy intercepted the flow of raindrops, and most of the water was coming down through the branches and the stems of the trees. From the leaves it Fig. 12.13 Rainwater drips from the trees and seeps into the ground Covered ground with decaying material acts like a sponge Rain The root system helps water to seep down in the ground The closed canopy and many layers of vegetation slow down the speed of raindrops Transpiration and evaporation Root system Water table",

After about half an hour, the rain stopped. They noticed that the layer of dead leaves over the forest floor appeared wet now. But water did not stagnate in the forest. Boojho thought that if it had rained so heavily in his town, it would have flooded the drains and roads. What would happen if it rains heavily in your town? Prof Ahmad told them that the forest also acts as a natural absorber of rainwater and allows it to seep. It helps maintain the water table throughout the year. Forests not only help in controlling floods but also help maintain the flow of water in the streams so that we get a steady supply of water. On the other hand, if trees are not present, rain hits the ground directly and may flood the area around it. Heavy rain may also damages the soil. Roots of trees normally bind the soil together, but in their absence the soil is washed away or eroded. The children spent an hour at Tibu\u2019s village on their way back. The weather of the village was quite pleasant. Villagers told them that due to the surrounding forest, they receive good rainfall. The air also remained cool. Noise pollution, too is less because the forest absorbs the noise of the nearby highway. The children learnt about the history of the village. It surprised them that the villages and the agricultural fields of that area were created after clearing the forest about sixty years ago. Tibu\u2019s grandfather told them that when he was young, the village was not as large as it was now. It was also surrounded by forests. Construction of roads, buildings, industrial development and increasing demand of wood created pressure on the forests and it started vanishing. He was not happy that the forest adjoining their village is not regenerating and is on the verge of disappearing due to overgrazing of animals and indiscriminate felling of trees. Prof Ahmad said that if we did things wisely we could preserve forests and environment as well as have development. Children prepared a few pictures to show the consequences of such an event. At the end of the visit, Prof Ahmad asked children to sum up the importance of forests. The children wrote: Forests provide us with oxygen. They protect soil and provide habitat to a large number of animals. Forests help in bringing good rainfall in neighbouring areas. They are a source of medicinal plants, timber and many other useful products. We must preserve our forests. What would happen if forests disappear?",

The production of new individuals from their parents is known as reproduction. But, how do plants reproduce? There are different modes of reproduction in plants which we shall learn in this chapter. 8.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION In Class VI you learnt about different parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the various parts of a plant and write the functions of each. Most plants have roots, stems and leaves. These are called the vegetative parts of a plant. After a certain period of growth, most plants bear flowers. You may have seen the mango trees flowering in spring. It is these flowers that give rise to juicy mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat the fruits and usually discard the seeds. Seeds germinate and form new plants. So, what is the function of flowers in plants? Flowers perform the function of reproduction in plants. Flowers are the reproductive parts. There are several ways by which plants produce their offspring. These are categorised into two types: (i) asexual, and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual reproduction plants can give rise to new plants without seeds, whereas in sexual Asexual reproduction In asexual reproduction new plants are obtained without production of seeds. Vegetative propagation It is a type of asexual reproduction in which new plants are produced from roots, stems, leaves and buds. Since reproduction is through the vegetative parts of the plant, it is known as vegetative propagation. Activity 8.1 Cut a branch of rose or champa with a node. This piece of branch is termed a cutting. Bury the cutting in the soil. A node is a part of the stem/branch at which a leaf arises (Fig. 8.1). Water the cutting every day and observe its growth.

If a leaf of this plant falls on a moist You must have seen flower buds developing into flowers. Apart from flower buds, there are buds in the axil (point of attachment of the leaf at the node) of leaves which develop into shoots. These buds are called vegetative buds (Fig. 8.2). A bud consists of a short stem around which immature overlapping leaves are present. Vegetative buds can also give rise to new plants. Activity 8.2 Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars on it with the help of a magnifying glass. You may find bud(s) in them. These scars are also called \u201ceyes\u201d. Cut the potato into small portions, each with an eye and bury them in the soil. Water the pieces regularly for a few days and observe their progress. What do you find?

After an hour, put a drop of this liquid on a glass slide and observe under a microscope. What do you observe? You may see the formation of new yeast cells (Fig. 8.5). from the main plant body. Each detached part can grow into a new plant. Fig. 8.4 Leaf of Bryophyllum with buds in the margin Boojho wants to know if there is any advantage of vegetative propagation. Plants produced by vegetative propagation take less time to grow and bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds. The new plants are exact copies of the parent plant, as they are produced from a single parent. Later in this chapter you will learn that plants produced by sexual reproduction have characters of both the parents. Plants produce seeds as a result of sexual reproduction. Budding You have already learnt about the tiny organisms like yeast can be seen only under a microscope. These grow and multiply every few hours if sufficient nutrients are made available to them. Remember that yeast is a single-celled organism. Let us see how they reproduce? The small bulb-like projection coming out from the yeast cell is called a bud. The bud gradually grows and gets detached from the parent cell and forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast cell grows, matures and produces more yeast cells. Sometimes, another bud arises from the bud forming a chain of buds. If this process continues, a large number of yeast cells are produced in a short time. Fragmentation You might have seen slimy green patches in ponds, or in other stagnant water bodies. These are the algae.

Each spore is covered by a hard protective coat to withstand unfavourable conditions such as high temperature and low humidity. So they can survive for a long time. Under favourable conditions, a spore germinates and develops into a new individual. Plants such as moss and ferns (Fig. 8.8) also reproduce by means of spores. 12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION You have learnt earlier the structure of a flower. You know that the flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant. Stamens are the male reproductive part and pistil is the female reproductive part (Fig. 8.9). water and nutrients are available algae grow and multiply rapidly by fragmentation. An alga breaks up into two or more fragments. These fragments or pieces grow into new individuals (Fig. 8.6). This process continues and they cover a large area in a short period of time.

The transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma of a flower is called pollination. If the pollen lands on the stigma of the same flower or another flower of the same plant, it is called self-pollination. When the pollen of a flower lands on the stigma of a flower of a different plant of the same kind, it is called cross-pollination [Fig. 8.10 (a) and (b)]. Fertilisation The cell which results after fusion of the gametes is called a zygote. The process of fusion of male and female Boojho wants to know why flowers are generally so colourful and fragrant. Is it to attract insects? Fig. 8.12 (a) Section of an apple, (b) Almond gametes (to form a zygote) is called fertilisation (Fig. 8.11).

The seeds develop from the ovules. The seed contains an embryo enclosed in a protective seed coat. Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such as mango and orange. Some fruits are hard like almonds and walnuts [Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)]. 8.4 SEED DISPERSAL In nature same kind of plants grow at different places. This happens because seeds are dispersed to different places. Sometimes after a walk through a forest or a field or a park, you may have found seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

What do you think will happen if all seeds of a plant were to fall at the same place and grow there? There would be severe competition for sunlight, water, minerals and space. As a result the seeds would not grow into healthy plants. Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It prevents competition between the plant and its own seedlings for sunlight, water and minerals. It also enables the plants to invade new habitats for wider distribution. Seeds and fruits of plants are carried away by wind, water and animals. Winged seeds such as those of drumstick and maple [Fig. 8.13 (a) and (b)], light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak (Madar) and hairy fruit of sunflower [Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the wind to far away places. Some seeds are dispersed by water. These fruits or seeds usually develop floating ability in the form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as in coconut. Some seeds are dispersed by animals, especially spiny seeds with hooks which get attached to the bodies of animals and are carried to distant places. Examples are Xanthium (Fig. 8.15) and Urena. Some seeds are dispersed when the fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds are scattered far from the parent plant. This happens in the case of castor and balsam.

Animals get their food from plants, either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that eat plants. Some animals eat both plants and animals. Recall that all organisms including humans require food for growth, repair and functioning of the body. Animal nutrition includes nutrient requirement, mode of intake of food and its utilisation in the body. You have studied in Class VI that food consists of many components.

Some aquatic animals filter tiny food particles floating nearby and feed upon them. Activity 2.1 What is the type of food and mode of feeding of the following animals?

After opening the shell, the starfish pops out its stomach through its mouth to eat the soft animal inside the shell. The stomach then goes back into the body and the food is slowly digested. 2.2 DIGESTION IN HUMANS We take in food through the mouth, digest and utilise it. The unused parts of the food are defecated. Have you ever wondered what happens to the food inside the body? The food passes through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2) which begins at the buccal cavity and ends at the anus. The canal can be divided into various compartments: (1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small intestine, (5) large intestine ending in the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a very long path? These parts together form the alimentary canal (digestive tract). The food components gradually get digested as food travels through the various compartments. The inner walls of the stomach and the small intestine, and the various glands associated with the canal such as salivary glands, the liver and the pancreas secrete digestive juices. The digestive juices convert complex substances of food into simpler ones. The digestive tract and the associated glands together constitute the digestive system.

However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating, many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release acids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar products are the major culprits of tooth decay. Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between two teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and rinse the mouth after every meal.

The foodpipe runs along the neck Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough, get hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage. Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel choked, get hiccups or cough. Food Oesophagus Stomach",
            "Page6": "SCIENCE 16 The working of the stomach was discovered by a strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole in his stomach. He was brought to an American army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved the patient but he could not close the hole properly and left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach through the hole. He made some wonderful observations. Beaumont found that the stomach was churning food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest the food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed. and the chest. Food is pushed down by movement of the wall of the foodpipe. Actually this movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and pushes the food downwards (Fig. 2.7). At times the food is not accepted by our stomach and is vomited out. Recall the instances when you vomited after eating and think of the reason for it. Discuss with your parents and teacher. The stomach The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its shape is like a flattened J and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal. It receives food from the food pipe at one end and opens into the small intestine at the other. The inner lining of the stomach secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and digestive juices. The mucous protects the lining of the stomach. The acid kills many bacteria that enter along with the food and makes the medium in the stomach acidic and helps the digestive juices to act. The digestive juices break down the proteins into simpler substances. The small intestine The small intestine is highly coiled and is about 7.5 metres long. It receives secretions from the liver and the pancreas. Besides, its wall also secretes juices. The liver is a reddish brown gland situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side. It is the largest gland in the body. It secretes bile juice that is stored in a sac called the gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays an important role in the digestion of fats. The pancreas is a large cream coloured gland located just below the stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins and changes them into simpler forms.

            "Page7": "NUTRITION IN ANIMALS 17 Diarrhoea Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently. This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children. Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). The partly digested food now reaches the lower part of the small intestine where the intestinal juice completes the digestion of all components of the food. The carbohydrates get broken into simple sugars such as glucose, fats into fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins into amino acids. Absorption in the small intestine The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine. This process is called absorption. The inner walls of the small intestine have thousands of finger-like outgrowths. These are called villi (singular villus). Can you guess what the role of villi could be in the intestine? The villi increase the surface area for absorption of the digested food. Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface. The surface of the villi absorbs the digested food materials. The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by the body. This is called assimilation. In the cells, glucose breaks down with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide and water, and energy is released. The food that remains undigested and unabsorbed enters into the large intestine. Large intestine The large intestine is wider and shorter than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre in length. Its function is to absorb water and some salts from the undigested food material. The remaining waste passes into the rectum and remains there as semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is removed through the anus from time-to-time. This is called egestion. 2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING ANIMALS Have you observed cows, buffaloes and other grass-eating animals chewing continuously even when they are not eating?

Many animals, including humans, cannot digest cellulose. Animals like horses, rabbit, etc., have a large sac-like structure called Caecum between the oesophagus and the small intestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the food is digested here by the action of certain bacteria which are not present in humans. So far you have learnt about animals which possess the digestive system. But there are many small organisms which do not have a mouth and a digestive system. Then, how do they acquire and digest food? In the section below you will learn another interesting way of food intake. 2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN AMOEBA Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled organism found in pond water. Amoeba has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense nucleus and many small bubble-like vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm. Amoeba constantly changes its shape and position. It pushes out one, or more finger-like projections, called pseudopodia or false feet for movement and capture of food.

The food becomes trapped in a food vacuole [Fig. 2.10). Digestive juices are secreted into the food vacuole. They act on the food and break it down into simpler substances. Gradually the digested food is absorbed. The absorbed substances are used for growth, maintenance and multiplication. The undigested residue of the food is expelled outside by the vacuole. The basic process of digestion of food and release of energy is the same in all animals. In a later chapter you will learn about the transport of food absorbed by the intestine to the various parts of the body.

Let us recall tastes of some edible substances listed in Table 4.1. If you have not tasted any of these substances taste it now and enter the result in Table 4.1. You find that some of these substances taste sour, some taste bitter, some taste sweet and some taste salty. 4.1 ACIDS AND BASES Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and vinegar taste sour. These substances taste sour because they contain acids. The chemical nature of such substances is acidic. The word acid comes from the Latin word acere which means sour. The acids in these substances are natural acids. What about baking soda? Does it also taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since, it does not taste sour it means, that it has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If you rub its solution between fingers, it feels soapy. Generally, substances like these which are bitter in taste and feel soapy on touching are known as bases. The nature of such substances is said to be basic. If we cannot taste every substance, how do we find its nature? Special type of substances are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic. These substances are known as indicators. The indicators change their colour when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance. Turmeric, litmus, China rose petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the naturally occurring indicators. CAUTION 1. Do not taste anything unless asked to do so. 2. Do not touch anything unless asked to do so.

It is extracted from lichens (Fig. 4.1a). It has a mauve (purple) colour in distilled water. When added to an acidic solution, it turns red and when added to a basic solution, it turns blue. It is available in the form of a solution, or in the form of strips of paper, known as litmus paper. Generally, it is available as red and blue litmus paper (Fig. 4.1b).

If possible make solutions in distilled water. Record your observations as in Table. 4.2. In your Table, are there any substances on which litmus had no effect? Name those substances. The solutions which do not change the colour of either red or blue litmus are known as neutral solutions. These substances are neither acidic nor basic.

The solution again becomes colourless. Again add one drop of sodium hydroxide solution. Is there any change in colour? The solution again becomes pink in colour. It is evident that when the solution is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink colour. On the other hand, when the solution is acidic, it remains colourless. Fig. 4.4 Process of neutralisation Demonstrate the effect of the three indicators on each of these solutions. Record your observations in Table 4.5. 4.3 NEUTRALISATION We have learnt that acids turn blue litmus red and bases turn red litmus blue. Let us see what happens when an acid is mixed with a base. We are going to use an indicator you have not used so far. It is called phenolphthalein. Activity 4.5 To be demonstrated by the teacher in the class Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute hydrochloric acid. Note down its colour. Note down the colour of phenolphthalein solution also. Add 2\u20133 drops of the indicator to the acid. Now shake the test tube gently. Do you observe any change in colour of the acid? Add to the acidic solution a drop of sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper. Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings, historical monuments, plants and animals. CAUTION Great care should be taken while handling laboratory acids and bases because these are corrosive in nature, irritating and harmful to skin. Base Acid + Indicator",
            "Page7": "SCIENCE 44 When an acidic solution is mixed with a basic solution, both the solutions neutralise the effect of each other. When an acid solution and a base solution are mixed in suitable amounts, both the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature of the base are destroyed. The resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Touch the test tube immediately after neutralisation. What do you observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat is always produced, or evolved. The evolved heat raises the temperature of the reaction mixture. In neutralisation reaction a new substance is formed. This is called salt. Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in nature. Thus, neutralisation can be defined as follows: The reaction between an acid and a base is known as neutralisation. Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat. Acid+Base \uf0ae Salt+Water (Heat is evolved) The following reaction is an example: Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) \uf0ae Sodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H2O) Boojho added dilute sulphuric acid to lime water. Will the reaction mixture become hot or cool? 4.4 NEUTRALISATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE Indigestion Our stomach contains hydrochloric acid. It helps us to digest food, as you have learnt in Chapter 2. But too much of acid in the stomach causes indigestion. Sometimes indigestion is painful. To relieve indigestion, we take an antacid such as milk of magnesia, which contains magnesium hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of excessive acid. Ant bite When an ant bites, it injects the acidic liquid (formic acid) into the skin. The effect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) or calamine solution, which contains zinc carbonate. Soil treatment Excessive use of chemical fertilisers makes the soil acidic. Plants do not grow well when the soil is either too acidic or too basic. When the soil is too acidic, it is treated with bases like quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked lime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil is basic, organic matter (compost) is added to it. Organic matter releases acids which neutralises the basic nature of the soil. Factory wastes The wastes of many factories contain acids. If they are allowed to flow into the water bodies, the acids will kill fish and other organisms. The factory wastes are, therefore, neutralised by adding basic substances.",

            "Page3": "FOREWORD The National Curriculum Framework (NCF), 2005, recommends that children\u2019s life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle marks a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home and community. The syllabi and textbooks developed on the basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They also attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp boundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures will take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred system of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). The success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals and teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own learning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must recognise that, given space, time and freedom, children generate new knowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults. Treating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one of the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored. Inculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat children as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of knowledge. These aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode of functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as rigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number of teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for teaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook proves for making children\u2019s life at school a happy experience, rather than a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to address the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and reorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for child psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook attempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space to opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small groups, and activities requiring hands-on experience. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) appreciates the hard work done by the Textbook Development Committee responsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the advisory group in Science and Mathematics, Professor J.V. Narlikar and the Chief Advisor for this book, Prof. V.B. Bhatia for guiding the work of this committee. Several teachers contributed to the development of this textbook; we are grateful to their principals for making this possible. We are indebted to the institutions and organisations which have generously permitted us to draw upon their resources, material and personnel. We are especially grateful to the members of the National Monitoring Committee,",

            "Page7": "PREFACE This book is the outcome of the efforts of the Textbook Development Committee appointed by the NCERT. The committee met a few times to interact with one another to improve the draft. Then there was a review meeting in which many experts and practicing school teachers were invited to review the draft and suggest improvements. By and large we have stuck to the format of the Class VI book. By now, famous characters, Boojho and Paheli, have been used to make the text interactive. Attempt has been made to recall children\u2019s own experiences and build concepts around them. This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their every-day life. Many activities have been suggested to clarify concepts. Some of these activities are so simple that children can perform them on their own. The requirement of the apparatus required for the activities is minimal. We performed all the activities ourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school situation. The activities should also help children in developing skills such as presentation of data in tabular and graphical forms, reasoning and drawing inference from the given data. The language of the book has been kept as simple as possible. A large number of photographs, illustrations, cartoons, etc. have been included to make the book attractive. To help teachers evaluate children effectively, a large number of exercises have been given at the end of each chapter. The teachers are encouraged to frame additional exercises to test children\u2019s understanding. Some challenging exercises have also been devised for those children who would like to appear for the National Talent Search Examination conducted by the NCERT. We are conscious of the fact that there is a paucity of additional reading material for children. We have tried to address this problem by providing non-evaluative boxes. These boxes, in blue, contain additional information, anecdotes, stories, strange facts and other such interesting materials. We all know that children are mischievous and playful by nature. Therefore, in order to prevent any untoward incident during the performance of the activities in the school or outside, necessary cautions, in red, have been inserted at various places in the book. To prepare children to assume their roles as responsible citizens of tomorrow, attempt has been made to sensitise them to the issues concerning gender, religion, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. We have sought to weave into the text the value of cooperation and the importance of peer learning. An important feature of the book is what we call \u2018Extended Learning\u2019. These are totally non-evaluative, and purely voluntary activities and projects. Some of the projects in this section have been designed to enhance children\u2019s interaction with the experts, teachers, even parents, and society at large. The children are required to collect information of various kind and draw conclusions of their own. My request to teachers and parents is to use the book in the spirit in which it has been written. Encourage children to perform activities and learn by doing, rather than by rote.",
            "Page8": "You can supplement, or even replace, the activities given here. If you feel that you have better alternatives, especially with your local/regional flavour, please write to us so that these activities could be used in the future editions of the book. We have been able to include only a small subset of children\u2019s experiences. You have a better knowledge of their experiences because you are in touch with them. Use them to illustrate the concepts being taught. Above all, please do not stifle children\u2019s natural curiosity. Encourage them to ask questions, even if sometimes you feel uncomfortable. If you do not know the answer to a question on the spot, do not feel embarrassed. You can promise them to find the answer and deal with it later. Make a genuine attempt to get the answer from whatever resources are within your reach, such as senior school or college teachers, experts, libraries, internet, etc. If, in spite of your efforts, you cannot get the answer to some question, you could write to NCERT. I must thank the NCERT for enabling us to talk to children through the medium of this book. Every member of the NCERT has been courteous and helpful to us.

Rich in lather, mixed with oil, black\u2013 brown water that goes down the drains from sinks, showers, toilets, laundries is dirty. It is called wastewater. This used water should not be wasted. We must clean it up by removing pollutants. Have you ever thought where the wastewater goes and what happens to it? 13.1 WATER, OUR LIFELINE Clean water is a basic need of human being. Let us make a mindmap of the many uses of clean water. Activity 13.1 (We have given one example of the use of clean water. You can add many more.) Clean water that is fit for use is unfortunately not available to all. It has been reported that more than one billion of people have no access to safe drinking water. This accounts for a large number of water-related diseases and even deaths. People even children walk for several kilometres to collect clean water. Is it not a serious matter for human dignity? The increasing scarcity of fresh-water due to population growth, pollution, industrial development,mismanagement and other factors. Realising the urgency of the situation on the World Water Day, on 22 March 2005, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed the period 2005\u20132015 as the International Decade for action on \u201cWater for life\u201d. All efforts made during this decade aim to reduce by half the number of people who do not have access to safe drinking water. There has been perceptible progress in the direction of the aim but still there is a lot to achieve. Cleaning of water is a process of removing pollutants before it enters a water body or is reused. This process of wastewater treatment is commonly Clean water put to use Drinking",
            "Page2": "WASTEWATER STORY 157 known as \u201cSewage Treatment\u201d. It takes place in several stages. 13.2 WHAT IS SEWAGE? Sewage is wastewater released by homes, industries, hospitals, offices and other users. It also includes rainwater that has run down the street during a storm or heavy rain. The water that washes off roads and rooftops carries harmful substances with it. Sewage is a liquid waste. Most of it is water, which has dissolved and suspended impurities. Activity 13.2 Locate an open drain near your home, school or on the roadside and inspect water flowing through it. Record colour, odour and any other observation. Discuss with your friends and your teacher and fill up the following Table 13.1. We know that sewage is a complex mixture containing suspended solids, organic and inorganic impurities, nutrients, saprophytes and disease causing bacteria and other microbes. These include the following. Organic impurities \u2013Human faeces, animal waste, oil, urea (urine), pesticides, herbicides, fruit and vegetable waste, etc. Inorganic impurities \u2013 Nitrates, Phosphates, metals. Nutrients \u2013 Phosphorus and Nitrogen. Bacteria \u2013 Such as vibrio cholera which causes cholera and salmonella paratyphi which causes typhoid. Other microbes \u2013 Such as protozones which cause dysentery. 13.3 WATER FRESHENS UP \u2014 AN EVENTFUL JOURNEY In a home or a public building generally one set of pipes brings clean water and another set of pipes takes away wastewater. Imagine that we could see through the ground. We would see a network of big and small pipes, called Table 13.1 Contaminant survey S.

Manholes are located at every 50 m to 60 m in the sewerage, at the junction of two or more sewers and at points where there is a change in direction. Activity 13.3 Study the sewage route in your home/ school/building. Do the following: \uf0a7 Make a line diagram of the sewage route. \uf0a7 Walk down the street or survey the campus to find the number of manholes. \uf0a7 If possible, observe open drain and record which living organisms are found in and around it. In case you do not have a sewerage system in your locality, find out how sewage is being disposed off. Treatment of polluted water Perform the following activity. It will help you understand the processes that take place at the wastewater treatment plant. Activity 13.4 Divide yourself into groups to perform the activity. Record observations at each stage: \uf0a7 Fill a large glass jar 3/4 full of water. Add some dirty organic matter such as grass pieces or orange peels, a small amount of detergent, and a few drops of an ink or any colour. \uf0a7 Cap the jar, shake it well and let the mixture stand in the sun for two days. \uf0a7 After two days, shake the mixture and pour a small sample into test tube. Label this test tube \u201cBefore treatment; Sample 1\u201d. How does it smell? \uf0a7 Use an aerator from an aquarium to bubble air through the sample in the glass jar. Allow several hours for aeration; leave the aerator attached overnight. If you do not have an aerator, use a mechanical stirrer or a mixer. You may have to stir it several times. \uf0a7 The next day when aeration is complete, pour another sample into a second test tube. Label it as \u201cAfter aeration; Sample 2\u201d. \uf0a7 Fold a piece of filter paper to form a cone. Wet the paper with tap water and then insert the cone in a funnel. Mount the funnel on a support (as you have learnt in Class VI). \uf0a7 Place layers of sand, fine gravel and finally medium gravel in the funnel (Fig. 13.2). (An actual filtration plant does not use filter paper, but the sand filter is several metres deep). \uf0a7 Pour the remaining aerated liquid through the filter into the beakers. Do not allow the liquid to spill over the filter. If the filtered liquid is not clear, filter it a few times till you get clear water. \uf0a7 Pour a sample of the filtered water into a third test tube labelled \u201cFiltered; Sample 3\u201d.",

Label the test tube \u201cChlorinated; Sample 4\u201d. \uf0a7 Observe carefully the samples in all the test tubes. Do not taste! Just smell them! Now answer the following questions: (a) What changes did you observe in the appearance of the liquid after aeration? (b) Did aeration change the odour? (c) What was removed by the sand filter? (d) Did chlorine remove the colour? (e) Did chlorine have an odour? Was it worse than that of the wastewater? 13.4 WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT (WWTP) Treatment of wastewater involves physical, chemical, and biological processes, which remove physical, chemical and biological matter that contaminates the wastewater. 1. Wastewater is passed through bar screens. Large objects like rags, sticks, cans, plastic packets, napkins are removed (Fig. 13.3). Fig. 13.2 Filtration process Fig. 13.3 Bar screen Fig. 13.4 Grit and sand removal tank 2. Water then goes to a grit and sand removal tank. The speed of the incoming wastewater is decreased to allow sand, grit and pebbles to settle down (Fig. 13.4). 3. The water is then allowed to settle in a large tank which is sloped towards the middle. Solids like faeces settle at the bottom and are removed with",
            "Page5": "SCIENCE 160 After several hours, the suspended microbes settle at the bottom of the tank as activated sludge. The water is then removed from the top. The activated sludge is about 97% water. The water is removed by sand drying beds or machines. Dried sludge is used as manure, returning organic matter and nutrients to the soil. The treated water has a very low level of organic material and suspended matter. It is discharged into a sea, a river or into the ground. Nature cleans it up further. Sometimes it may be necessary to disinfect water with chemicals like chlorine and ozone before releasing it into the distribution system. Become an active citizen Waste generation is a natural part of human activity. But we can limit the a scraper. This is the sludge. A skimmer removes the floatable solids like oil and grease. Water so cleared is called clarified water (Fig. 13.5). The sludge is transferred to a separate tank where it is decomposed by the anaerobic bacteria. The biogas produced in the process can be used as fuel or can be used to produce electricity. 4. Air is pumped into the clarified water to help aerobic bacteria to grow. Bacteria consume human waste, food waste, soaps and other unwanted matter still remaining in clarified water (Fig. 13.6). Fig. 13.6 Aerator Did you know ? It has been suggested that we should plant eucalyptus trees all along sewage ponds. These trees absorb all surplus wastewater rapidly and release pure water vapour into the atmosphere. The water in a river is cleaned naturally by processes that are similar to those adopted in a wastewater treatment plant. Fig. 13.5 Water clarifier",

The situation worsens in the rainy season when the drains start overflowing. We have to wade through the mud pools on the roads. Most unhygienic and unsanitary conditions prevail. Flies, mosquitoes and other insects breed in it. You can be an enlightened citizen and approach the municipality or the gram panchayat. Insist that the open drains be covered. If the sewage of any particular house makes the neighbourhood dirty, you should \uf0a7 Chemicals like paints, solvents, insecticides, motor oil, medicines may kill microbes that help purify water. So do not throw them down the drain. \uf0a7 Used tealeaves, solid food remains, soft toys, cotton, sanitary towels, etc. should also be thrown in the dustbin (Fig. 13.7). These wastes choke the drains. They do not allow free flow of oxygen. This hampers the degradation process. Don\u2019t add to the load of WWTP. Paheli wonders how! request them to be more considerate about others\u2019 health. 13.5 BETTER HOUSEKEEPING PRACTICES One of the ways to minimise or eliminate waste and pollutants at their source is to see what you are releasing down the drain. \uf0a7 Cooking oil and fats should not be thrown down the drain. They can harden and block the pipes. In an open drain the fats clog the soil pores reducing its effectiveness in filtering water. Throw oil and fats in the dustbin. Fig. 13.7 Do not throw everything in the sink",
            "Page7": "SCIENCE 162 13.6 SANITATION AND DISEASE Poor sanitation and contaminated drinking water is the cause of a large number of diseases. Let us look at our own country. A vast number of our people are still without sewerage facilities. Where do they relieve themselves? A very large fraction of our people defecates in the open, on dry riverbeds, on railway tracks, near fields and many a time directly in water. Untreated human excreta is a health hazard. It may cause water pollution and soil pollution. Both the surface water and groundwater get polluted. Groundwater is a source of water for wells, tubewells, springs and many rivers. Thus, it becomes the most common route for water borne diseases. They include cholera, typhoid, polio, meningitis, hepatitis and dysentery. Bhoojo wants to know how sewage is disposed of in an aeroplane. 13.7 ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR SEWAGE DISPOSAL To improve sanitation, low cost onsite sewage disposal systems are being encouraged. Examples are septic tanks, chemical toilets, composting pits. Septic tanks are suitable for places where there is no sewerage system, for hospitals, isolated buildings or a cluster of 4 to 5 houses. Some organisations offer hygienic on-site human waste disposal technology. These toilets do not require scavenging. Excreta from the toilet seats flow through covered drains into a biogas plant. The biogas produced is used as a source of energy. 13.8 SANITATION AT PUBLIC PLACES In our country fairs are organised periodically. A large number of people participate in them. In the same way railway stations, bus depots, airports, hospitals are very busy places. Thousands of people visit them daily. Large amount of waste is generated Vermi-processing toilet A design of a toilet in which humans excreta is treated by earthworms has been tested in India. It has been found to be a novel, low water-use toilet for safe processing of human waste. The operation of the toilet is very simple and hygienic. The human excreta is completely converted to vermi cakes \u2014 a resource much needed for soil. In the year 2016, the Government of India has initiated a new mission known as \u201cSwachh Bharat\u201d under which a lot of drives such as proper sewage disposal and providing toilets for everyone have been started.",

This is called sewage. \uf06e Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution. \uf06e Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant. \uf06e Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature can take care of it. \uf06e Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are not available, the low cost on-site sanitation system can be adopted. \uf06e By-products of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas. \uf06e Open drain system is a breeding place for flies, mosquitoes and organisms which cause diseases. \uf06e We should not defecate in the open. It is possible to have safe disposal of excreta by low cost methods. here. It must be disposed of properly otherwise epidemics could break out. The government has laid down certain standards of sanitation but, unfortunately, they are not strictly enforced. However, all of us can contribute in maintaining sanitation at public places. We should not scatter litter anywhere. If there is no dustbin in sight, we should carry the litter home and throw it in the dustbin. Conclusion We all have a role to play in keeping our environment clean and healthy. You Mahatma Gandhi said: \u201cNo one need to wait for anyone else to adopt a humane and enlightened course of action.\u201d must realise your responsibility in maintaining the water sources in a healthy state. Adopting good sanitation practices should be our way of life. As an agent of change your individual initiative will make a great difference. Influence others with your energy, ideas and optimism.
